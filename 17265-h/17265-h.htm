<h1>COMPANION TO THE BIBLE.</h1>
<h2>BY REV. E.P. BARROWS, D.D.,</h2>
<h3>PROFESSOR OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE.</h3>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>{3}</span>
<h2>GENERAL PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The design of the present work, as its title indicates, is to
assist in the study of God's word. The author has had special
reference to teachers of Bible classes and Sabbath-schools;
ministers of the gospel who wish to have ready at hand the results
of biblical investigation in a convenient and condensed form; and,
in general, the large body of intelligent laymen and women in our
land who desire to pursue the study of Scripture in a thorough and
systematic way.</p>
<p>The First Part contains a concise view of the Evidences of
Revealed Religion. Here, since Christianity rests on a basis of
historic facts, special prominence has been given to the historic
side of these evidences; those, namely, which relate to the
genuineness, integrity, authenticity, and inspiration of the
several books of the Bible. A brief view is added of the evidences
which are of an internal and experimental character.</p>
<p>In the Introductions to the Old and New Testament which follow
in the Second and Third Parts, the general facts are first given;
then an account of the several divisions of each, with their office
and mutual relations, and such a notice of each particular book as
will prepare the reader to study it intelligently and
profitably.</p>
<p>The Fourth Part is devoted to the Principles of Biblical
Interpretation. Here the plan is to consider the Scriptures, first,
on the human side, as addressed to men in human language and
according to human modes of thinking and speaking; then, on the
divine side, as containing a true revelation from God, and
differing in this respect from all other writings. To this twofold
view the author attaches great importance. To the human side belong
the ordinary principles of interpretation, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>{4}</span> which apply
alike to all writings; to the divine side, the question of the
unity of revelation, and the interpretation of types and
prophecies.</p>
<p>In each of the abovenamed divisions the author has endeavored to
keep prominently in view the unity of revelation and the
inseparable connection of all its parts. It is only when we thus
contemplate it as a glorious whole, having beginning, progress, and
consummation, that we can truly understand it. Most of the popular
objections to the Old Testament have their foundation in an
isolated and fragmentary way of viewing its facts and doctrines;
and they can be fairly met only by showing the relation which these
hold to the entire plan of redemption.</p>
<p>The plan of the present work required brevity and condensation.
The constant endeavor has been to state the several facts and
principles as concisely as could be done consistently with a true
presentation of them in an intelligible form. It may be objected
that some topics, those particularly which relate to the
Pentateuch, are handled in too cursory a way. The author feels the
difficulty; but to go into details on this subject would require a
volume. He has endeavored to do the best that was consistent with
the general plan of the work. The point of primary importance to be
maintained is the divine authority and inspiration of the
Pentateuch&mdash;the whole Pentateuch as it existed in our
Saviour's day and exists now. There are difficult questions
connected with both its form and the interpretation of certain
parts of it in respect to which devout believers may honestly
differ. For the discussion of these the reader must be referred to
the works professedly devoted to the subject.</p>
<p>The present volume is complete in itself; yet it does not
exhaust the circle of topics immediately connected with the study
of the Bible. It is the author's purpose to add another volume on
Biblical Geography and Antiquities, with a brief survey of the
historic relations of the covenant people to the Gentile world.</p>

<h3>EVIDENCES OF REVEALED RELIGION.</h3>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>{27}</span>
<h3>PREFATORY REMARKS.</h3>
<p>Many thousands of persons have a full and joyous conviction of
the truth of Christianity from their own experience, who yet feel a
reasonable desire to examine the <i>historic evidence</i> by which
it is confirmed, if not for the strengthening of their own faith,
yet for the purpose of silencing gainsayers, and guarding the young
against the cavils of infidelity. It is our duty to give to those
who ask us a reason of the hope that is in us; and although our own
personal experience may be to ourselves a satisfactory ground of
assurance, we cannot ask others to take the gospel on our testimony
alone. It is highly desirable that we understand and be able to set
forth with clearness and convincing power the proofs that this plan
of salvation has God for its author.</p>
<p>Then there is a class of earnest inquirers who find themselves
perplexed with the difficulties which they hear urged against the
gospel, and which they find themselves unable to solve in a
satisfactory way. It is of the highest importance that such persons
be met in a candid spirit; that the immense mass of evidence by
which the Christian religion is sustained be clearly set before
them; and that they understand that a religion thus supported is
not to be rejected on the ground that there are difficulties
connected with it which have not yet been solved&mdash;perhaps
never can be solved here below.</p>
<p>Are you, reader, such an earnest inquirer after truth? We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span>
present to you in the following pages a brief summary of the
historic evidence by which the Bible, with the plan of salvation
which it reveals, is shown to be the word of God; and we wish, here
at the outset, to suggest to you some cautions respecting the state
of mind with which this great inquiry is to be pursued.</p>
<p>First of all, we remind you that, whatever else may be
uncertain, you know that you must soon die, and try for yourself
the realities of the unseen world. The question now before you is,
Whether God has spoken from heaven, and made any revelations
concerning that world. If so, they are more precious than gold; for
in the decisive hour of death you will wish to know not what man,
the sinner, has reasoned and conjectured concerning a future
judgment, forgiveness of sin, and the life to come; but what God,
the Judge, has declared. Now the Bible claims to contain such a
message from God. If its claims are valid, it will not flatter you
and speak to you smooth things, but will tell you the truth. And
you must be prepared to receive the truth, though it condemn you.
Sooner or later you must meet the truth face to face: be ready to
do so now; you have no interest in error; falsehood and delusion
cannot help you, but will destroy you.</p>
<p>Do not come to the examination of this great question with the
idea that you must clear away all mysteries connected with the
gospel before you believe it. The world in which you live is full
of mysteries. One would think that if any thing could be fully
comprehended, it must be the acts of which we are ourselves the
authors. By a volition you raise your hand to your head; but
<i>how</i> is the act performed? True, there is in your body an
apparatus of nerves, muscles, joints, and the like; but in what way
does the human will have power over this apparatus? No man can
answer this question: it is wrapped <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page29" id="page29"></a>{29}</span> in deep mystery. Why be
offended, then, because the way of salvation revealed in the Bible
has like mysteries&mdash;mysteries concerning not your duty, but
God's secret and inscrutable methods of acting?</p>
<p>And since the question now before you is not one of mere
speculation, but one that concerns your immediate duty, be on your
guard against the seductive influence of sinful passion and sinful
habit. There is a deep and solemn meaning in the words of Jesus:
"Every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
light, lest his deeds should be reproved." Corrupt feeling in the
heart and corrupt practice in the life have a terrible power to
blind the mind. The man who comes to the examination of the Bible
with a determination to persist in doing what he knows to be wrong,
or in omitting what he knows to be right, will certainly err from
the truth; for he is not in a proper state of mind to love it and
welcome it to his soul.</p>
<p>Remember also that it is not the grosser passions and forms of
vice alone that darken the understanding and alienate the heart
from the truth. Pride, vanity, ambition, avarice&mdash;in a word,
the spirit of self-seeking and self-exaltation in every
form&mdash;will effectually hinder the man in whose bosom they bear
sway from coming to the knowledge of the truth; for they will
incline him to seek a religion which flatters him and promises him
impunity in sin, and will fatally prejudice him against a system of
doctrines and duties so holy and humbling as that contained in the
Bible. Take, as a comprehensive rule for the investigation of this
weighty question, the words of the Saviour: "If any man will do his
will"&mdash;the will of God&mdash;"he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." So far as you
already know the will of God, do it; do it sincerely, earnestly,
and prayerfully, and God will give <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page30" id="page30"></a>{30}</span> you more light. He loves the
truth, and sympathizes with all earnest and sincere inquirers after
it. He never leaves to fatal error and delusion any but those who
love falsehood rather than truth, because they have pleasure in
unrighteousness. Open your heart to the light of heaven, and God
will shine into it from above; so that, in the beautiful words of
our Saviour, "the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright
shining of a candle doth give thee light."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>{31}</span>
<hr />
<h2>EVIDENCES OF REVEALED RELIGION.</h2>
<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h3>
<p>I. The Christian religion is not a mere system of ideas, like
the philosophy of Plato or Aristotle. It rests on a <i>basis of
historic facts</i>. The great central fact of the gospel is thus
expressed by Jesus himself: "God so loved the world that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life," John 3:16; and by the apostle
Paul thus: "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners." 1 Tim. 1:15. With the appearance of God's Son in human
nature were connected a series of mighty works, a body of divine
teachings, the appointment of apostles and the establishment of the
visible Christian church; all which are matters of historic
record.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. It is the constant doctrine of Christ and his
apostles that he came in accordance with the scriptures of the Old
Testament, and that his religion is the fulfilment of the types and
prophecies therein contained: "Think not that I am come to destroy
the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
Matt. 5:17. "All things must be fulfilled which were written in the
law of Moses, and in the prophets, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span> and in the psalms concerning
me." Luke 24:44. The facts of the New Testament connect themselves,
therefore, immediately with those of the Old, so that the whole
series constitutes an indivisible whole. The Bible is, from
beginning to end, the record of a supernatural revelation made by
God to men. As such, it embraces not only supernatural teachings,
but supernatural facts also; and the teachings rest on the facts in
such a way that both must stand or fall together.</p>
<p>II. This basis of supernatural facts, then, must be firmly
maintained against unbelievers whose grand aim is to <i>destroy the
historic foundation</i> of the gospel, at least so far as it
contains supernatural manifestations of God to men. Thus they would
rob it of its divine authority, and reduce it to a mere system of
human doctrines, like the teachings of Socrates or Confucius, which
men are at liberty to receive or reject as they think best. Could
they accomplish this, they would be very willing to eulogize the
character of Jesus, and extol the purity and excellence of his
precepts. Indeed, it is the fashion of modern unbelievers, after
doing what lies in their power to make the gospel a mass of
"cunningly-devised fables" of human origin, to expatiate on the
majesty and beauty of the Saviour's character, the excellence of
his moral precepts, and the benign influence of his religion. But
the transcendent glory of our Lord's character is inseparable from
his being what he claimed to be&mdash;the Son of God, coming from
God to men with supreme authority; and all the power of his gospel
lies in its being received as a message from God. To make the
gospel human, is to annihilate it, and with it the hope of the
world.</p>
<p>III. When the inquiry is concerning a long series of events
intimately connected together so as to constitute one inseparable
whole, two methods of investigation are open to us. We may look at
the train of events in the order of time from beginning to end; or
we may select some one great event of especial prominence and
importance as the <i>central point</i> of inquiry, and from that
position look forward and backward. The latter of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>{33}</span> these two
methods has some peculiar advantages, and will be followed in the
present brief treatise. We begin with the great central fact of
revelation already referred to, that "the Father sent the Son to be
the Saviour of the world." 1 John 4:14. When this is shown to rest
on a foundation that cannot be shaken, the remainder of the work is
comparatively easy. From the supernatural appearance and works of
the Son of God, as recorded in the four gospels, the supernatural
endowment and works of his apostles, as recorded in the Acts of the
Apostles, and their authoritative teachings, as contained in their
epistles, follow as a natural and even necessary sequel. Since,
moreover, the universal rule of God's government and works is,
"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the
ear," (Mark 4:28,) it is most reasonable to suppose that such a
full and perfect revelation as that which God has made to us by his
Son, which is certainly "the full corn in the ear," must have been
preceded by exactly such preparatory revelations as we find
recorded in the Old Testament. Now Jesus of Nazareth appeared among
the Jews, the very people that had the scriptures of the Old
Testament, and had been prepared for his advent by the events
recorded in them as no other nation was prepared. He came, too, as
he and his apostles ever taught, to carry out the plan of
redemption begun in them. From the position, then, of Christ's
advent, as the grand central fact of redemption, we look backward
and forward with great advantage upon the whole line of
revelation.</p>
<p>IV. We cannot too earnestly inculcate upon the youthful inquirer
the necessity of thus looking at <i>revelation as a whole</i>.
Strong as are the evidences for the truth of the gospel narratives
considered separately, they gain new strength, on the one side,
from the mighty revelations that preceded them and prepared the way
for the advent of the Son of God; and on the other, from the mighty
events that followed his advent in the apostolic age, and have been
following ever since in the history of the Christian church. The
divine origin of the Mosaic institutions can be shown on solid
grounds, independently of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page34" id="page34"></a>{34}</span> New Testament; but on how much
broader and deeper a foundation are they seen to rest, when we find
(as will be shown hereafter, chap. 8) that they were preparatory to
the incarnation of Jesus Christ. As in a burning mass, the heat and
flame of each separate piece of fuel are increased by the
surrounding fire, so in the plan of redemption, each separate
revelation receives new light and glory from the revelations which
precede and follow it. It is only when we view the revelations of
the Bible as thus progressing "from glory to glory," that we can
estimate aright the proofs of their divine origin. If it were even
possible to impose upon men as miraculous a particular event, as,
for example, the giving of the Mosaic law on Sinai, or the stones
of the day of Pentecost, the idea that there could have been
imposed on the world a series of such events, extending through
many ages, and yet so connected together as to constitute a
harmonious and consistent whole, is a simple absurdity. There is no
explanation of the unity that pervades the supernatural facts of
revelation, but that of their divine origin.</p>
<p>V. In strong contrast with this rational way of viewing the
facts of revelation as a grand whole, is the fragmentary method of
objectors. A doubt here, a cavil there, an insinuation yonder; a
difficulty with this statement, an objection to that, a discrepancy
here&mdash;this is their favorite way of assailing the gospel. If
one chooses to treat the Bible in this narrow and uncandid way, he
will soon plunge himself into the mire of unbelief. Difficulties
and objections should be candidly considered, and allowed their due
weight; but they must not be suffered to override irrefragable
proof, else we shall soon land in universal skepticism: for
difficulties, and some of them too insoluble, can be urged against
the great facts of nature and natural religion, as well as of
revelation. To reject a series of events supported by an
overwhelming weight of evidence, on the ground of unexplained
difficulties connected with them, involves the absurdity of running
into a hundred difficulties for the sake of avoiding five. If we
are willing to examine the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
id="page35"></a>{35}</span> claims of revelation as a whole, its
divine origin will shine forth upon us like the sun in the
firmament. Our difficulties we can then calmly reserve for further
investigation here, or for solution in the world to come.</p>
<p>VI. When we institute an examination concerning the facts of
revelation, the first question is that of the genuineness and
uncorrupt preservation of the books in which they are recorded; the
next, that of their authenticity and credibility. We may then
conveniently consider the question of their inspiration. In
accordance with the plan marked out above, (No. III.,) the gospel
narratives will be considered first of all; then the remaining
books of the New Testament. After this will be shown the
inseparable connection between the facts of revelation recorded in
the Old Testament and those of the New; and finally, the
genuineness of the books which constitute the canon of the Old
Testament, with their authenticity and inspiration. The whole
treatise will be closed by a brief view of the internal and
experimental evidences which commend the Bible to the human
understanding and conscience as the word of God.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>{36}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>GENUINENESS OF THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES.</h3>
<p>I. <i>Preliminary Remarks.</i> 1. A book is <i>genuine</i> if
written by the man whose name it bears, or to whom it is ascribed;
or when, as in the case of several books of the Old Testament, the
author is unknown, it is genuine if written in the age and country
to which it is ascribed. A book is <i>authentic</i> which is a
record of facts as opposed to what is false or fictitious; and we
call it <i>credible</i> when the record of facts which it professes
to give is worthy of belief. Authenticity and credibility are,
therefore, only different views of the same quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of a book that deals mainly with <i>principles</i>,
the question of authorship is of subordinate importance. Thus the
book of Job, with the exception of the brief narratives with which
it opens and closes, and which may belong to any one of several
centuries, is occupied with the question of Divine providence. It
is not necessary that we know what particular man was its author,
or at what precise period he wrote. We only need reasonable
evidence (as will be shown hereafter) that he was a prophetical
man, writing under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. But the case of
the gospel narratives is wholly different. They contain a record of
the supernatural appearance and works of the Son of God, on the
truth of which rests our faith in the gospel. So the apostle Paul
reasons: "If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
your faith is also vain." 1 Cor. 15:14. It is, then, of vital
importance that we know the relation which the authors of these
narratives held to Christ. If they were not <i>apostles</i> or
<i>apostolic men</i>, that is, associates of the apostles, laboring
with them, enjoying their full confidence, and in circumstances to
obtain their information directly from them&mdash;but, instead of
this, wrote after the apostolic age&mdash;their testimony is not
worthy of the unlimited faith which the church in all ages has
reposed in it. The question, then, of the genuineness of the gospel
narratives and that of their authenticity and credibility must
stand or fall together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. In respect to the <i>origin</i> of the gospels, as also of
the other books of the New Testament, the following things should
be carefully remembered:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>{37}</span>
<p><i>First.</i> There was a period, extending, perhaps, through
some years from the day of Pentecost, when there were no written
gospels, their place being supplied by the living presence and
teachings of the apostles and other disciples of our Lord.</p>
<p><i>Secondly.</i> When the need of written documents began to be
felt, they were produced, one after another, as occasion suggested
them. Thus the composition of the books of the New Testament
extended through a considerable period of years.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly.</i> Besides the gospels universally received by the
churches, other narratives of our Lord's life were attempted, as we
learn from the evangelist Luke (1:1); but those never obtained
general currency. The churches everywhere received the four gospels
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, because of the clear evidence
which they had of their apostolic origin and trustworthiness; and
because, also, these gospels, though not professing to give a
complete account of our Lord's life and teachings, were
nevertheless sufficiently full to answer the end for which they
were composed, being not fragmentary sketches, but orderly
narratives, each of them extending over the whole course of our
Lord's ministry. The other narratives meanwhile gradually passed
into oblivion. The general reception of these four gospels did not,
however, come from any formal concert of action on the part of the
churches, (as, for example, from the authoritative decision of a
general council, since no such thing as a general council of the
churches was known till long after this period;) but simply from
the common perception everywhere of the unimpeachable evidence by
which their apostolic authority was sustained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The narratives referred to by Luke were earlier than his gospel.
They were not spurious, nor, so far as we know, unauthentic; but
rather imperfect. They must not be confounded with the apocryphal
gospels of a later age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. In respect to the quotations of Scripture by the early
fathers of the church, it is important to notice their habit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>{38}</span>
quoting anonymously, and often in a loose and general way. They
frequently cite from memory, blending together the words of
different authors, and sometimes intermingling with them their own
words. In citing the prophecies of the Old Testament in an
argumentative way, they are, as might have been expected, more
exact, particularly when addressing Jews; yet even here they often
content themselves with the scope of the passages referred to,
without being particular as to the exact words.</p>
<p>With the above preliminary remarks, we proceed to consider the
evidences, external and internal, for the genuineness of the gospel
narratives.</p>
<p>II. <i>External Evidences.</i> 4. Here we need not begin at a
later date than the last quarter of the second century. This is the
age of Iren&aelig;us in Gaul, of Tertullian in North Africa, of
Clement of Alexandria in Egypt, and of some other writers. Their
testimony to the apostolic origin and universal reception of our
four canonical gospels is as full as can be desired. They give the
names of the authors, two of them&mdash;Matthew and
John&mdash;apostles, and the other two&mdash;Mark and
Luke&mdash;companions of apostles and fellow-laborers with them,
always associating Mark with Peter, and Luke with Paul; they affirm
the universal and undisputed reception of these four gospels from
the beginning by all the churches; and deny the apostolic authority
of other pretended gospels. In all this, they give not their
individual opinions, but the common belief of the churches. It is
conceded on all hands that in their day these four gospels were
universally received by the churches as genuine and authoritative
records of our Lord's life and works, to the exclusion of all
others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Iren&aelig;us</i> was a native of Asia Minor, of Greek
descent; but the seat of his labors was Lyons and Vienne in Gaul,
of the former of which places he became bishop after the martyrdom
of Pothinus, about A.D. 177. He was born about A.D. 140, and
suffered martyrdom under Septimius Severus A.D. 202. In his youth
he was a disciple of Polycarp, who was in turn a disciple of the
apostle John. In a letter to one Florinus, which Eusebius has
preserved, (Hist. Eccl., 5. 20,) he gives, in glowing language, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>{39}</span>
recollections of the person and teachings of Polycarp, and tells
with what interest he listened as this man related his intercourse
with the apostle John and the others who had seen the Lord, "how he
recounted their words, and the things which he had heard from them
concerning the Lord, and concerning his miracles and teaching." And
he adds that these things which Polycarp had received from
eye-witnesses he related "all in agreement with the Scriptures;"
that is, obviously, with the gospel narratives. Pothinus, the
predecessor of Iren&aelig;us at Lyons, was ninety years old at the
time of his martyrdom, and must have been acquainted with many who
belonged to the latter part of the apostolic age. Under such
circumstances, it is inconceivable that Iren&aelig;us, who knew the
Christian traditions of both the East and the West, should not have
known the truth respecting the reception of the gospels by the
churches, and the grounds on which this reception rested, more
especially in the case of the gospel of John. Tischendorf, after
mentioning the relation of Iren&aelig;us to Polycarp the disciple
of John, asks, with reason: "Are we, nevertheless, to cherish the
supposition that Iren&aelig;us never heard a word from Polycarp
respecting the gospel of John, and yet gave it his unconditional
confidence&mdash;this man Iren&aelig;us, who in his controversies
with heretics, the men of falsification and apocryphal works,
employs against them, before all other things, the pure Scripture
as a holy weapon?" (Essay, When were Our Gospels Written, p. 8.)
The testimony of Iren&aelig;us is justly regarded as of the most
weighty character. The fact that he gives several fanciful reasons
why there should be only four gospels, (Against Heresies, 3. 11,)
does not invalidate his statement of the fact that the churches had
always received four, and no more. We always distinguish between
men's testimony to facts of which they are competent witnesses, and
their philosophical explanations of these facts.</p>
<p><i>Tertullian</i> was born in Carthage about A.D. 160, and died
between A.D. 220 and 240. About A.D. 202 he joined the sect of the
Montanists; but this does not affect his testimony respecting the
origin and universal reception of the four canonical gospels. His
works are very numerous, and in them all he insists with great
earnestness that the gospel narratives, as also the other apostolic
writings, have been received without corruption, as a sacred
inheritance, from the apostolic churches. His work against Marcion,
whom he accuses of employing a mutilated gospel of Luke, is
particularly instructive as showing how deep and settled was the
conviction of the early Christians that nothing could be a gospel
which did not proceed from apostles or apostolic men; and how
watchful they were against all attempts to mutilate or corrupt the
primitive apostolic records. In defending the true gospel of Luke
against the mutilated form of it employed by Marcion, he says: "I
affirm that not in the apostolic churches alone, but in all which
are joined with them in the bond of fellowship, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>{40}</span> that gospel
of Luke which we most firmly maintain, has been valid from its
first publication; but Marcion's gospel is unknown to most of them,
and known to none, except to be condemned." This testimony of
Tertullian is very important, as showing his full conviction that
Marcion could not deny the universal reception, from the beginning,
of the genuine gospel of Luke. And a little afterwards he adds:
"The same authority of the apostolic churches will defend the other
gospels also, which we have in like manner through them, and
according to them," (Against Marcion, 4. 5.) Many more quotations
of like purport might be added.</p>
<p><i>Clement of Alexandria</i> was a pupil of Pant&aelig;nus, and
his successor as head of the catechetical school at Alexandria in
Egypt. He was of heathen origin, born probably about the middle of
the second century, and died about A.D. 220. He had a philosophical
turn of mind, and after his conversion to Christianity made
extensive researches under various teachers, as he himself tells
us, in Greece, in Italy, in Palestine, and other parts of the East.
At last he met with Pant&aelig;nus in Egypt, whom he preferred to
all his other guides, and in whose instructions he rested. The
testimony of Clement to the universal and undisputed reception by
the churches of the four canonical gospels as the writings of
apostles or apostolic men, agrees with that of Tertullian. And it
has the more weight, not only on account of his wide
investigations, but because, also, it virtually contains the
testimony of his several teachers, some of whom must have known, if
not the apostles themselves, those who had listened to their
teachings.</p>
<p>In connection with the testimony of the above-named writers, we
may consider that of the <i>churches of Lyons and Vienne</i> in
Gaul, in a letter addressed by them to "the churches of Asia and
Phrygia," which Eusebius has preserved for us, (Hist. Eccl., 5. 1,)
and which describes a severe persecution through which they passed
in the reign of Antoninus Verus, about A.D. 177. In this they say:
"So was fulfilled that which was spoken by our Lord, 'The time
shall come in which whosoever killeth you shall think that he doeth
God service.'" In speaking again of a certain youthful martyr, they
first compare him to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist,
affirming, in the very words of Luke, that he "had walked in all
the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless," (Luke 1:6;)
and then go on to describe him as "having the Comforter in himself,
the Spirit, more abundantly than Zacharias," where they apply to
the Holy Spirit a term peculiar to the apostle John. Here, then, we
have indubitable testimony to the fact that the gospel of John, as
well as of Luke, was known to the churches of Gaul in the west and
Asia Minor in the east in the days of Pothinus, bishop of these
churches, who suffered martyrdom in this persecution. But Pothinus
was ninety years old, so that his knowledge of these gospels must
have reached back to the first quarter of the second century, when
many who had known the apostles were yet living.</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>{41}</span>
<p>5. These testimonies, let it be carefully remembered, apply not
to one part of Christendom alone, but to all its different and
distant divisions; and that, too, long before there was any attempt
to bring the judgment of the churches into harmony by means of
general councils. The orthodox churches planted in the different
provinces of the Roman empire, though in substantial harmony with
each other, had nevertheless their minor differences, which were
sometimes discussed with much warmth. In their relation to each
other, they were jealous of their freedom and independence. The
history of the so-called <i>Antilegomena</i> (Disputed Books of the
New Testament, chap. 6) shows that the reception of a writing as
apostolic in one division of Christendom, did not insure its
reception elsewhere. Had it been possible that a spurious book
should be imposed as genuine on the churches of one region, it
would certainly have met with opposition in other regions; but our
four canonical gospels were everywhere received without dispute as
the writings of apostles or apostolic men. This fact admits of but
one explanation: the churches had from their first appearance
indubitable evidence of their genuineness.</p>
<p>6. Let it be further remembered that this testimony relates not
to books of a private character, that might have lain for years
hidden in some corner; but to the <i>public writings</i> of the
churches, on which their faith was founded, of which they all had
copies, and which it was the custom, from the apostolic age, to
read in their assemblies along with the law and the prophets.
(Justin Martyr Apol., 1. 67.) Earnestness and sincerity are traits
which will not be denied to the primitive Christians, and they were
certainly not wanting in common discernment. Let any man show, if
he can, how a spurious gospel, suddenly appearing somewhere after
the apostolic days, could have been imposed upon the churches as
genuine, not only where it originated, but everywhere else in
Christendom. The difficulty with which some of the genuine books of
the New Testament gained universal currency sufficiently refutes
such an absurd supposition.</p>
<p>7. We are now prepared to consider the testimonies of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>{42}</span>
earlier period. Here <i>Justin Martyr</i> is a very weighty
witness, since he lived so near the apostolic age, and had every
facility for investigating the history of the gospel narratives. He
was born near the beginning of the second century, and his extant
works date from about the middle of the same century. Before his
conversion to Christianity he was a heathen philosopher earnestly
seeking for the truth among the different systems of the age. Of
his undoubtedly genuine works, there remain to us two Apologies
(defences of Christianity) and a Dialogue with Trypho a Jew,
designed to defend the Christian religion against its Jewish
opponents. In these he quotes the gospel of Matthew very
abundantly; next in number are his quotations from Luke. His
references to Mark and John are much fewer, but enough to show his
acquaintance with them. He never quotes the evangelists by name,
but designates their writings as "The Memoirs of the Apostles;" and
more fully, "The memoirs which I affirm to have been composed by
his"&mdash;our Lord's&mdash;"apostles and their followers,"
Dialog., ch. 103, "which," he elsewhere says, "are called gospels,"
Apol. 1. 66, and in a collective sense, "the gospel," Dialog., ch.
10. It should be carefully noticed that he speaks in the plural
number both of the apostles who composed the gospels and their
followers. This description applies exactly to our canonical
gospels&mdash;two written by apostles, and two by their
followers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attempt has been made in modern times to set aside Justin's
testimony, on the alleged ground that he quotes not from our
canonical gospels, but from some other writings. The groundlessness
of this supposition is manifest at first sight. Justin had visited
the three principal churches of Rome, Alexandria, and Ephesus. It
is certain that he knew what gospels were received by them in his
day as authentic, and that these are the very gospels which he
quotes, affirming that they were the writings of apostles and their
followers. Now, that the gospels which Justin used should have been
wholly supplanted by others in the days of Iren&aelig;us, who was
of full age at the time of Justin's death, is incredible. But
Iren&aelig;us, in common with Clement, Tertullian, and others,
quotes our four canonical gospels as alone possessing apostolic
authority, and as having been always received by the churches. It
follows that the "Memoirs" of Justin must be the same gospels. We
cannot conceive that in this brief period <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span> an entire
change of gospels should have been made throughout all the
different and distant provinces of the Roman empire, at a time when
concerted action through general councils was unknown; and that,
too, in so silent a manner that no record of it remains in the
history of the church. The supposition that the gospels known to
Justin were different from those received by Iren&aelig;us ought
not to be entertained without irrefragable proof. But no such proof
exists. "An accurate examination in detail of his citations," says
Semisch, Life of Justin Martyr, 4. 1, "has led to the result that
this title"&mdash;the Memoirs of the Apostles&mdash;"designates the
canonical gospels&mdash;a result in no way less certain because
again called in question in modern days."</p>
<p>The agreement of his quotations with our present gospels is of
such a character and extent as can be explained only from his use
of them. The variations are mainly due to his habit of quoting
loosely from memory. "Many of these citations," says Kirchhofer,
"agree, word for word, with the gospels; others with the substance,
but with alterations and additions of words, with transpositions
and omissions; others give the thought only in a general way;
others still condense together the contents of several passages and
different sayings, in which case the historic quotations are yet
more free, and blend together, in part, the accounts of Matthew and
Luke. But some quotations are not found at all in our canonical
gospels," (see immediately below;) "some, on the contrary, occur
twice or thrice." Quellensammlung, p. 89. note. Two or three more
important variations are, perhaps, due to the readings in the
manuscripts employed by Justin, since the later church fathers,
who, as we know, employed the canonical gospels, give the same
variations. Finally, Justin gives a few incidents and sayings not
recorded in our present gospels. As he lived so near the apostolic
times he may well have received these from tradition; but if in any
case he took them from written documents, there is no proof that he
ascribed to such documents apostolic authority. In one passage, he
accurately distinguishes between what he gives from tradition or
other written sources, and what from the apostolic records. "When
Jesus came," he says, "to the river Jordan, where John was
baptizing, as he descended to the water, both was a fire kindled in
the Jordan, and as he ascended from the water, the apostles of this
very Christ of ours have written that the Holy Spirit as a dove
lighted upon him." Dial., ch. 88.</p>
<p>It has been doubted whether certain references to the <i>gospel
of John</i> can be found in Justin's writings; but it seems plain
that the following is a free quotation from chapter 3:3-5: "For
Christ said, Except ye be born again, ye shall by no means enter
into the kingdom of heaven. But that it is impossible that they who
have once been born should enter into the wombs of those who bare
them is manifest to all." Apol. 1. 61. To affirm that a passage so
peculiar as this was borrowed by both the evangelist <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span> John and
Justin from a common tradition, is to substitute a very improbable
for a very natural explanation. Besides, Justin uses phraseology
peculiar to John, repeatedly calling our Saviour "the Word of God,"
and "the Word made flesh;" affirming that he "was in a peculiar
sense begotten the only Son of God," "an only begotten One to the
Father of all things, being in a peculiar sense begotten of him as
Word and Power, and afterwards made man through the Virgin;" and
calling him "the good Rock that sends forth (literally, causes to
<i>bubble forth</i>&mdash;compare John 4:14) living waters into the
hearts of those who through him have loved the Father of all
things, and that gives to all who will the water of life to drink."
These and other references to John may be seen in Kirchhofer's
Quellensammlung, pp. 146, 147.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>8. Another early witness is <i>Papias</i>, who was bishop of
Hierapolis, in Phrygia, in the first half of the second century. He
wrote "An Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord," in five books.
This work has perished; but fragments of it, with notices of its
contents, are preserved to us by Eusebius and other writers. As
Papias, according to his own express testimony, gathered his
materials, if not from apostles themselves, yet from their
immediate disciples, his statements are invested with great
interest. Of Matthew he says, Eusebius Hist. Eccl., 5. 39, that he
"wrote the oracles in the Hebrew dialect, and every one interpreted
them as he could." He speaks of this interpretation by each one as
he could as something past, implying that in his day our present
Greek gospel of Matthew (of the apostolic authority of which there
was never any doubt in the early churches) was in circulation,
whether it was or was not originally composed in Hebrew, a question
on which learned men are not agreed. Of Mark he affirms that,
"having become Peter's interpreter, he wrote down accurately as
many things as he remembered; not recording in order the things
that were said or done by Christ, since he was not a hearer or
follower of the Lord, but afterwards"&mdash;after our Lord's
ascension&mdash;"of Peter, who imparted his teachings as occasion
required, but not as making an orderly narrative of the Lord's
discourses." Hist. Eccl., 3. 39. The fact that Eusebius gives no
statement of Papias respecting the other <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span> two gospels
is of little account, since his notices of the authors to whom he
refers, and of their works, are confessedly imperfect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eusebius notices, for example, Hist. Eccl. 4. 14, the fact that
Polycarp, in his letter to the Philippians, "has used certain
testimonies from the First Epistle of Peter;" but says nothing of
his many references, in the same letter, to the epistles of Paul,
in some of which he quotes the apostle by name. We have,
nevertheless, through Eusebius, an indirect but valid testimony
from Papias to the authorship of the fourth gospel, resting upon
the admitted identity of the author of this gospel with the author
of the first of the epistles ascribed to John. Speaking of Papias,
Eusebius says: "But the same man used testimonies from the First
Epistle of John." Hist. Eccl., 3. 39, end. The ascription to John
of this epistle, is virtually the ascription to him of the fourth
gospel also. Eusebius speaks of Papias as a man "of very small
mind." The correctness of this judgment is manifest from the
specimens which he gives of his writings; but it cannot invalidate
the evidence we have from the above passages of the existence, in
Papias' day, of the gospels to which he refers. As to the question
whether these were our present canonical gospels of Matthew and
Mark, it is sufficient to say that neither Eusebius nor any of the
church fathers understood them differently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>9. A very interesting relic of antiquity is the <i>Epistle to
Diognetus</i>, of which the authorship is uncertain. Its date
cannot be later than the age of Justin Martyr, to whom it is
ascribed by some. It is, notwithstanding some erroneous views, a
noble defence of Christianity, in which the author shows his
acquaintance with the gospel of John by the use of terms and
phrases peculiar to him. Thus he calls Christ "the Word," and "the
only begotten Son," whom God sent to men. In the words, "not to
take thought about raiment and food," section 9, there is an
apparent reference to Matt. 6:25, 31.</p>
<p>In addition to the above testimonies might be adduced some
fragments of early Christian writers which have been preserved to
us by those of a later day; but for brevity's sake they are
omitted.</p>
<p>10. Following up the stream of testimony, we come now to that of
the so-called <i>apostolic fathers</i>; that is, of men who were
disciples of apostles, and wrote in the age next following them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span>
Holding, as they do, such a near relation to the apostles, and
familiar with the oral traditions of the apostolic age, we cannot
expect to find in them such frequent and formal references to the
books of the New Testament as characterize the works of later
writers. They quote, for the most part, anonymously, interweaving
with their own words those of the sacred writers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the earliest among the apostolic fathers is <i>Clement of
Rome</i>, who died about A.D. 100. Of the numerous writings
anciently ascribed to him, his First Epistle to the Corinthians is
admitted, upon good evidence, to be genuine. In this we find words
which imply a knowledge of the first three gospels. Citing
evidently from memory, in a loose way, he says: "For thus
he"&mdash;the Lord Jesus&mdash;"spake, 'Be merciful, that ye may
obtain mercy; forgive, that ye may be forgiven; as ye do, so shall
it be done to you; as ye give, so shall it be given to you; as ye
judge, so shall ye receive judgment; as ye are kind, so shall ye
receive kindness; with what measure ye measure, with that it shall
be measured to you.'" And again: "For he said, 'Woe unto that man;
it were better for him that he had not been born, than that he
should offend one of my elect.'"</p>
<p><i>Ignatius</i> was bishop of the church at Antioch, and
suffered martyrdom A.D. 107, or according to some accounts, 116. In
his epistles, which are received as genuine, are manifest
quotations from the gospel of Matthew, and some apparent though not
entirely certain allusions to the gospel of John.</p>
<p><i>Polycarp</i>, bishop of Smyrna, was a disciple of the apostle
John. He suffered martyrdom about the year 166. Of his writings,
only one short epistle, addressed to the Philippians, remains to
us; but this abounds in references to the books of the New
Testament, especially the epistles of Paul. Of quotations from the
gospel of Matthew, the following are examples: "Judge not, that ye
be not judged; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; be merciful, that
ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye mete, it shall be
measured to you again." "Blessed are the poor in spirit, and those
that suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven." "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak." For the gospel of John, Polycarp's testimony, though
indirect, is decisive. In his letter to the Philippians, he quotes
from the First Epistle of John, "For every one who does not confess
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is antichrist." 1 John
4:3. But that the gospel of John and this first epistle both
proceeded from the same author, is a conceded fact.</p>
<p>The recently discovered Sinai Codex, the oldest known codex in
the world, contains the entire <i>Epistle of Barnabas</i> in the
original Greek. In <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id=
"page47"></a>{47}</span> this we find, among other references to
the first three gospels, one to the <i>written</i> gospel of
Matthew of the most decisive character: "Let us be mindful,
therefore, lest perchance we be found as it is written, 'Many are
called, but few are chosen.'" Matt. 20:16; 22:14. The form of
quotation, "as it is written," is employed by the writers of the
New Testament only of citations from Scripture. In these words the
writer places the gospel of Matthew in the same rank as the
Scriptures of the Old Testament. That he was the Barnabas mentioned
in the New Testament as the companion of Paul cannot be maintained;
but the composition of the epistle is assigned, with probability,
to the beginning of the second century, though some place it as
late as its close.</p>
<p>The testimony of other apocryphal writings of early date might
be adduced, but for the sake of brevity it is here omitted. It may
be seen in the essay of Tischendorf, already referred to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>11. A different class of witnesses will next be
considered&mdash;the ancient Syriac version, the old Latin version,
and the Muratorian fragment on the canon of the New
Testament&mdash;all of which bear testimony to our canonical
gospels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ancient <i>Syriac</i> version, commonly called the
Peshito&mdash;<i>simple</i>, that is, expressing simply the meaning
of the original, without allegorical additions and explanations,
after the manner of the Jewish Targums&mdash;is admitted by all to
be of very high antiquity. Learned men are agreed that this version
cannot well be referred to a later date than the close of the
second century, and some assign it to the middle of the second
century, at which time the Syrian churches were in a very
flourishing condition, and cannot well be supposed to have been
without a version of the Holy Scriptures. The Peshito contains all
the books of the New Testament, except the Second Epistle of Peter,
the Second and Third Epistles of John, the Epistle of Jude, and the
Apocalypse. It testifies to the existence of our four gospels, not
only when it was made, but at an earlier date; since we must, in
all probability, assume that some considerable time elapsed after
the composition, one by one, of the books of the New Testament,
before they were collected into a volume, as in this Syriac
version.</p>
<p>Respecting the <i>Old Latin</i> version, (in distinction from
Jerome's revision, commonly called the <i>Vulgate</i>, which
belongs to the fourth century,) various opinions have been
maintained. Some have assumed the existence of several independent
Latin versions of the New Testament, or of some of its books; but
the preferable opinion is that there were various recensions, all
having for their foundation a single version, namely, the Old
Latin; which, says Westcott, Canon of the New Testament, ch. 3,
"can be traced back <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id=
"page48"></a>{48}</span> as far as the earliest records of Latin
Christianity. Every circumstance connected with it indicates the
most remote antiquity." It was current in north Africa, at least
soon after the middle of the second century. Though it has not come
down to us in a perfect form, it contains, along with most of the
other books of the New Testament, our four canonical gospels; and
its testimony is of the greatest weight.</p>
<p>The <i>Muratorian</i> Fragment on the <i>Canon</i> is the name
given to a Latin fragment discovered by the Italian scholar,
Muratori, in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, in a manuscript
bearing the marks of great antiquity. Its date is determined by its
reference to the shepherd of Hermas, which, says the Fragment,
Hermas "wrote very recently in our times, while the bishop Pius,
his brother, occupied the chair of the church at Rome." The later
of the two dates given for the death of Pius is A.D. 157. The
composition of the Fragment must have followed soon afterwards.
Though mutilated at the beginning, as well as the end, its
testimony to the existence of the <i>four</i> canonical gospels is
decisive. In its present form, it opens with the end of a sentence,
the beginning of which is lost. It then goes on to say, "<i>The
third gospel according to Luke</i>." After mentioning various
particulars concerning Luke, as that he was a physician whom Paul
had taken with him, that he did not himself see the Lord in the
flesh, etc., it adds, "<i>The fourth of the gospels, that of John,
of the number of the disciples</i>," to which it appends a
traditional account of the circumstances of its composition. With
the truth or falsehood of this account we have at present no
concern; the important fact is that this very ancient canon
recognizes the existence of our four canonical gospels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>12. The heretical sects of the second century furnish testimony
to the genuineness of our canonical gospels which is of the most
weighty and decisive character. Though some of them rejected
certain books of the New Testament and mutilated others, it was on
doctrinal, not on critical grounds. Had they attempted to disprove
on historic grounds the genuineness of the rejected portions of
Scripture, it is certain that the church fathers, who wrote against
them at such length, would have noticed their arguments. The fact
that they did not, is conclusive proof that no such attempt was
made; but from the position which the leaders of these heretical
sects occupied, it is certain that, could the genuineness of the
canonical gospels, or any one of them, have been denied on historic
grounds, the denial would have been made.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>{49}</span>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Marcion</i>, one of the most distinguished leaders of those
who separated themselves from the orthodox church, came to Rome in
the second quarter of the second century. He separated Christianity
from all connection with Judaism, making the Jehovah of the Old
Testament a different being from the God of the New Testament. His
gospel, called by the ancients the gospel of Marcion, is admitted
to have been a mutilated copy of Luke's gospel. Of course it became
necessary that he should reject the first two chapters of this
gospel, (which alone he received,) since they contain our Lord's
genealogy in the line of Abraham and David, and should otherwise
alter it to suit his views. On the same grounds, he altered the
epistles of Paul also. That Marcion was not ignorant of the other
three gospels, but rejected them, is plain from the words of
Tertullian, who accuses him, Against Marcion, 4. 3, of attempting
"to destroy the credit of those gospels which are properly such,
and are published under the name of apostles, or also of apostolic
men; that he may invest his own gospel with the confidence which he
withdraws from them." His real ground for rejecting some books of
the New Testament and mutilating others was that <i>he</i> could
judge better of the truth than the writers themselves, whom he
represented to have been misled by the influences of Jewish
prejudices. Accordingly Iren&aelig;us well says of the liberties
taken by Marcion, Against Heresies, 1. 27: "He persuaded his
disciples that he was himself more trustworthy than the apostles
who have delivered to us the gospel; while he gave to them not the
gospel, but a fragment of the gospel."</p>
<p>A distinguished leader of the Gnostics was <i>Valentinus</i>,
who came to Rome about A.D. 140, and continued there till the time
of Anicetus. His testimony and that of his followers is, if
possible, more weighty than even that of Marcion. His method,
according to the testimony of Tertullian, was not to reject and
mutilate the Scriptures, but to pervert their meaning by false
interpretations. Tertullian says, Against Heretics, ch. 38: "For
though Valentinus seems to use the entire instrument, he has done
violence to the truth with a more artful mind than Marcion." "The
entire instrument"&mdash;Latin, <i>integro
instrumento</i>&mdash;includes our four canonical gospels. Clement
of Alexandria and Hippolytus have preserved quotations from
Valentinus in which he refers to the gospels of Matthew, Luke, and
John. See Westcott, Canon of the New Testament, 4. 5. Respecting
the gospel of John in particular, Iren&aelig;us says, Against
Heresies, 3. 11, that "the Valentinians make the most abundant use
of it." Heracleon, whom Origen represents as having been a familiar
friend of Valentinus, wrote a commentary on John, from which Origen
frequently quotes; but if Valentinus and his followers, in the
second quarter of the second century, used "the entire instrument,"
they must have found its apostolic authority established upon a
firm foundation before their day. This carries us back to the age
immediately succeeding that of the apostles, when Polycarp and
others <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id=
"page50"></a>{50}</span> who had known them personally were yet
living. The testimony of the Valentinians, then, is of the most
decisive character.</p>
<p>Another prominent man among the heretical writers was
<i>Tatian</i>, a contemporary and pupil of Justin Martyr, who,
according to the testimony of Eusebius, Epiphanius, and Theodoret,
composed a <i>Diatessaron</i>, that is, a <i>four-fold gospel</i>;
which can be understood only as a harmony of the four gospels
which, as has been shown, were used by Justin; or of such parts of
these gospels as suited his purpose; for Tatian, like Marcion,
omitted all that relates to our Lord's human descent. With this
Diatessaron, Theodoret was well acquainted; for he found among his
churches more than two hundred copies, which he caused to be
removed, and their places supplied by the four canonical
gospels.</p>
<p>As to other gospels of the second century, which are
occasionally mentioned by later writers, as "The Gospel of Truth,"
"The Gospel of Basilides," etc., there is no evidence that they
professed to be connected histories of our Lord's life and
teachings. They were rather, as Norton has shown, Genuineness of
the Gospels, vol. 3, chap. 4, doctrinal works embodying the views
of the sectaries that used them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13. We have seen how full and satisfactory is the external
evidence for our four canonical gospels. Considering how scanty are
the remains of Christian writings that have come down to us from
the first half of the same century, we have all the external
evidence for that period also that could be reasonably demanded,
and it is met by no rebutting testimony that rests on historic
grounds. The authorship of no ancient classical work is sustained
by a mass of evidence so great and varied, and the candid mind can
rest in it with entire satisfaction.</p>
<p>III. <i>Internal Evidences.</i> 14. Here we may begin with
considering the relation of the first three gospels to the last, in
respect to both time of composition and character.</p>
<p>And first, with respect to <i>time</i>. The first three
gospels&mdash;frequently called the <i>synoptical</i> gospels, or
the <i>synoptics</i>, because from the general similarity of their
plan and materials their contents are capable of being summed up in
a synopsis&mdash;record our Lord's prophecy of the overthrow of
Jerusalem. The three records of this prediction wear throughout the
costume of a true prophecy, not of a prophecy written after the
event. They are occupied, almost exclusively, with the various
<i>signs</i> by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id=
"page51"></a>{51}</span> which the approach of that great
catastrophe might be known, and with admonitions to the disciples
to hold themselves in readiness for it. Matthew, for example,
devotes fifty verses to the account of the prophecy and the
admonitions connected with it. Of these, only four, chap. 24:19-22,
describe the calamities of the scene, and that in the most general
terms. Now, upon the supposition that the evangelist wrote before
the event, all this is natural. Our Lord's design in uttering the
prophecy was not to gratify the idle curiosity of the disciples,
but to warn them beforehand in such a way that they might escape
the horrors of the impending catastrophe. He dwelt, therefore,
mainly on the signs of its approach; and with these, as having a
chief interest for the readers, the record of the prediction is
mostly occupied. It is impossible, on the other hand, to conceive
that one who wrote years after the destruction of the city and
temple should not have dwelt in more detail on the bloody scenes
connected with their overthrow, and have given in other ways also a
historic coloring to his account. We may safely say that to write a
prophecy after the event in such a form as that which we have in
either of the first three gospels, transcends the power of any
uninspired man; and as to inspired narratives, the objectors with
whom we are now dealing deny them altogether.</p>
<p>But there are, in the record of this prophecy, some special
indications of the time when the evangelists wrote. According to
Matthew, the disciples asked, ver. 3: "When shall these
things"&mdash;the destruction of the buildings of the
temple&mdash;"be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of
the end of the world?" These questions our Lord proceeded to answer
in such a way that the impression on the minds of the hearers (to
be rectified only by the course of future events) must have been
that the overthrow of the temple and city would be connected with
his second coming and the end of the world. "Immediately after the
tribulation of those days," says Matthew, "shall the sun be
darkened," etc. The probable explanation of this peculiar form of
the prophecy is that it does actually include <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> all three
events; the fulfilment which it had in the destruction of the city
and temple by the Romans being only an earnest of a higher
fulfilment hereafter. But however this may be, it is important to
notice that the evangelists, in their record of the prophecy, are
evidently unconscious of any discrepancy, real or apparent, that
needs explanation; which could not have been the case had they
written years after the event predicted. "It may be safely held,"
says Professor Fisher, Supernatural Origin of Christianity, p. 172,
"that had the evangelist been writing at a later time, some
explanation would have been thrown in to remove the <i>seeming</i>
discrepancy between prophecy and fulfilment."</p>
<p>It should be further noticed that the evangelists Matthew and
Mark, in reference to "the abomination of desolation" standing in
the holy place, throw in the admonitory words, "Let him that
readeth understand." These are not the Saviour's words, but those
of the narrators calling the attention of believers to a most
important sign requiring their immediate flight to the mountains.
Before the overthrow of the city these words had a weighty office;
after its overthrow they would have been utterly superfluous. Their
presence in such a connection is proof that the record was written
before the event to which it refers.</p>
<p>Admitting the genuineness and authenticity of the book of Acts,
(which will be considered hereafter,) we have a special proof of
the early composition of the gospel according to Luke. The book of
Acts ends abruptly with Paul's two years residence at Rome, which
brings us down to A.D. 65, five years before the destruction of
Jerusalem. The only natural explanation of this fact is that here
the composition of the book of Acts was brought to a close. The
date of the gospel which preceded, Acts 1:1, must therefore be
placed still earlier.</p>
<p>If, now, we examine the gospel of John, we find its internal
character agreeing with the ancient tradition that it was written
at Ephesus late in the apostle's life. That it was composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>{53}</span>
at a distance from Judea, in a Gentile region, is manifest from his
careful explanation of Jewish terms and usages, which among his
countrymen would have needed no explanation. No man writing in
Judea, or among the Galileans who habitually attended the national
feasts at Jerusalem, would have said, "And the passover, a feast of
the Jews, was nigh," 6:4; "Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was
at hand," 7:2, etc. The absence of all reference to the overthrow
of the Jewish polity, civil and ecclesiastical, may be naturally
explained upon the supposition that the apostle wrote some years
after that event, when his mind had now become familiar with the
great truth that the Mosaic institutions had forever passed away to
make room for the universal dispensation of Christianity; and that
he wrote, too, among Gentiles for whom the abolition of these
institutions had no special interest. In general style and spirit,
moreover, the gospel of John is closely allied to his first
epistle, and cannot well be separated from it by a great interval
of time; but the epistle undoubtedly belongs to a later period of
the apostle's life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the language of John, chap. 5:2, "Now there <i>is</i> at
Jerusalem, by the sheep-gate, a pool, which is called in the Hebrew
tongue, Bethesda, <i>having</i> five porches,"&mdash;it has been
argued that, when John wrote, the city must have been still
standing. But Eusebius speaks of the pool as remaining in his day,
and why may not the porches, as useful to the Roman conquerors,
have been preserved, at least for a season?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have seen the relation of John's gospel to the other three in
respect to time. It must have been written several years later than
the last of them; perhaps not less than fifteen years. If, now, we
look to its relation in regard to <i>character</i>, we must say
that it differs from them as widely as it well could while
presenting to our view the same divine and loving Saviour. Its
general plan is different. For reasons not known to us, the
synoptical gospels are mainly occupied with our Lord's ministry in
Galilee. They record only his last journey to Jerusalem, and the
momentous incidents connected with it. John, on the contrary,
notices his visits to Jerusalem year by year. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span> Hence his
materials are, to a great extent, different from theirs; and even
where he records the same events&mdash;as, for example, the miracle
of the loaves and fishes, and the last supper&mdash;he connects
with them long discourses, which the other evangelists have
omitted. Particularly noticeable are our Lord's oft-repeated
discussions with the unbelieving Jews respecting his Messiahship,
and his confidential intercourse with his disciples, in both of
which we have such treasures of divine truth and love. How
strikingly this gospel differs from the others in its general style
and manner every reader feels at once. It bears throughout the
impress of John's individuality, and by this it is immediately
connected with the epistles that bear his name. It should be added
that in respect to the time when our Lord ate the passover with his
disciples there is an apparent disagreement with the other three
gospels, which the harmonists have explained in various ways.</p>
<p>The essential point of the above comparison is this:
Notwithstanding the striking difference between the later fourth
gospel and the earlier three, it was at once received by all the
churches as of apostolic authority. Now upon the supposition of its
genuineness, both its peculiar character and its undisputed
reception everywhere are easily explained. John, the bosom disciple
of our Lord, wrote with the full consciousness of his apostolic
authority and his competency as a witness of what he had himself
seen and heard. He therefore gave his testimony in his own
independent and original way. How far he may have been influenced
in his selection of materials by a purpose to supply what was
wanting in the earlier gospels, according to an old tradition, it
is not necessary here to inquire; it is sufficient to say that,
under the illumination of the Holy Spirit, he marked out that
particular plan which we have in his gospel, and carried it out in
his own peculiar manner, thus opening to the churches new mines, so
to speak, of the inexhaustible fulness of truth and love contained
in him in whom "dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily."
And when this original gospel, so different in its general plan and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>{55}</span>
style from those that preceded, made its appearance, the apostolic
authority of its author secured its immediate and universal
reception by the churches. All this is very plain and
intelligible.</p>
<p>But upon the supposition that the gospel of John is a spurious
production of the age succeeding that of the apostles, let any one
explain, if he can, how it could have obtained universal and
unquestioned apostolic authority. Its very difference from the
earlier gospels must have provoked inquiry and examination, and
these must have led to its rejection, especially at a time when
some who had known the apostle yet survived; and no one now
pretends to assign to it a later period.</p>
<p>15. We will next consider the relation of the first three
gospels to each other. Here we have remarkable agreements with
remarkable differences. The general plan of all three is the same.
It is manifest also, at first sight, that there lies at the
foundation of each a basis of common matter&mdash;common not in
substance alone, but to a great extent in form also. Equally
manifest is it that the three evangelists write independently of
each other. Matthew, for example, did not draw his materials from
Luke; for there is his genealogy of our Lord, and his full account
of the sermon on the mount, not to mention other particulars. Nor
did Luke take his materials from Matthew; for there is his
genealogy also, with large sections of matter peculiar to himself.
Mark has but little matter that is absolutely new; but where he and
the other two evangelists record the same events, if one compares
his narratives with theirs, he finds numerous little incidents
peculiar to this gospel woven into them in a very vivid and graphic
manner. They come in also in the most natural and artless way, as
might be expected from one who, if not himself an eye-witness,
received his information immediately from eye-witnesses. The three
writers, moreover, do not always agree as to the order in which
they record events; yet, notwithstanding the diversities which they
exhibit, they were all received from the first as of equal
authority.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>{56}</span>
<p>The natural explanation of this is that all three wrote in the
apostolic age, and consequently had access, each of them
independently of the other two, to the most authentic sources of
information. These sources (so far as the evangelists were not
themselves eye-witnesses) lay partly, perhaps, in written documents
like those referred to by Luke, 1:1, partly in the unwritten
traditions current in the apostolic churches, and partly in
personal inquiry from eye-witnesses, especially, in the case of
Mark and Luke, from apostles themselves. From these materials each
selected as suited his purposes, and the churches everywhere
unhesitatingly received each of the three gospels, notwithstanding
the above-named variations between them, because they had undoubted
evidence of their apostolic authority. We cannot suppose that after
the apostolic age three gospels, bearing to each other the relation
which these do, could have been imposed upon the churches as all of
them equally authentic. We know from the history of Marcion's
gospel how fully alive they were to the character of their sacred
records. On apostolic authority they could receive&mdash;to mention
a single example&mdash;both Matthew's and Luke's account of our
Lord's genealogy; but it is certain that they would not have
received the two on the authority of men who lived after the
apostolic age.</p>
<p>16. In the gospel narratives are numerous incidental allusions
to passing events without the proper sphere of our Lord's labors,
to social customs, and to the present posture of public affairs,
civil and ecclesiastical. In all these the severest scrutiny has
been able to detect <i>no trace of a later age</i>. This is a
weighty testimony to the apostolic origin of the gospels. Had their
authors lived in a later age, the fact must have manifested itself
in some of these references. The most artless writer can allude in
a natural and truthful way to present events, usages, and
circumstances; but it transcends the power of the most skilful
author to multiply incidental and minute references to a past age
without betraying the fact that he does not belong to it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>{57}</span>
<p>17. Every age has, also, its peculiar impress of thought and
reasoning in religious, not less than in secular matters. Although
the gospel itself remains always the same, and those who sincerely
embrace it have also substantially the same character from age to
age, there is, nevertheless, continual progress and change in men's
apprehension of the gospel and its institutions, and consequently
in their manner of reasoning concerning them. No man, for example,
could write a treatise on Christianity at the present day without
making it manifest that he did not belong to the first quarter of
the present century. The primitive age of Christianity is no
exception to this universal law. Under the auspices of the apostles
it began to move forward, and it continued to move after their
decease. The pastoral epistles of Paul bear internal marks of
having been written in the later period of his life, because they
are adapted to the state of the Christian church and its
institutions that belonged to that, and not to an earlier period.
If, now, we examine the writings of the so-called apostolic
fathers&mdash;disciples of the apostles, who wrote after their
death&mdash;we find in them circles of thought and reasoning not
belonging to the canonical writings of the New Testament, least of
all to the canonical gospels, though they are evidently derived
from hints contained in these writings, whether rightly or wrongly
apprehended. In this respect, the works of the apostolic fathers
are distinguished in a very marked way from those which bear the
names of the apostles themselves or their associates.</p>
<p>18. Another decisive argument lies in the <i>character of the
Greek</i> employed by the evangelists, in common with the other
writers of the New Testament. It is the Greek language employed by
Jews, (or, in the case of Luke, if his Jewish origin be
doubted&mdash;see Col. 4:11, 16&mdash;by one who had received a
Jewish training under the influence of the Greek version of the Old
Testament,) and therefore pervaded and colored by Hebrew idioms.
This peculiar form of the Greek language belongs to the apostolic
age, when the teachers and writers of the church <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span> were Jews.
After the overthrow of Jerusalem, the dispersion of the Jewish
nation, and the death of the apostles and their associates, it
rapidly disappeared. Thenceforward the writers of the church were
of Gentile origin and training, in accordance with the Saviour's
memorable words: "The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and
given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof."</p>
<p>These internal proofs, coinciding as they do with a mass of
external evidences so great and varied, place the genuineness of
the four canonical gospels on a foundation that cannot be
shaken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>UNCORRUPT PRESERVATION OF THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES.</h3>
<p>1. It is necessary, first of all, to define what is meant in the
present connection by the uncorrupt preservation of the gospel
narratives. When a man, whose business it is to examine and compare
manuscripts or editions of a work, speaks of a given text as
corrupt, he means one thing; in a question concerning the truth of
the Christian system as given in the writings of the New Testament,
a corrupt text means something very different. The collator of
manuscripts understands by a corrupt text one that has been marred
by the carelessness or bad judgment of transcribers, whence have
arisen so many "various readings," though these do not change, or
essentially obscure the facts and doctrines of Christianity, as has
been most conclusively shown by the results of modern textual
criticism; but in an inquiry whether we have in our canonical
gospels the account of our Lord's life and teachings as it was
originally written by the evangelists in all essential particulars,
we have to do with the question, not of various readings, such as
are incident to all manuscripts, but of essential additions,
alterations, or mutilations&mdash;like those, for example, which
Marcion attempted&mdash;by which the facts and doctrines themselves
are changed or obscured. It is against the charge of such essential
corruptions that we maintain the integrity of the text in the
gospels, as in the other books of the New Testament.</p>
<p>2. The most important materials for writing in ancient times
were the paper made of the Egyptian <i>papyrus</i>
plant&mdash;whence the word <i>paper</i>&mdash;and
<i>parchment</i>, prepared from the skins of animals, the finer
kinds of which are called <i>vellum</i>. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>{60}</span> Both are of
high antiquity. The use of the above-mentioned paper was very
common in the apostolic age; and from an incidental notice in the
New Testament, (2 John 12 compared with 3 John 13,) it appears to
have been the material employed by the apostles themselves. But the
use of parchment became more common in the following centuries,
while that of papyrus-paper gradually ceased. To this circumstance
we owe, in a great measure, the preservation of our oldest
manuscripts; for the papyrus-paper was of a very perishable nature,
and the manuscripts written upon it that have come down to us from
high antiquity have been kept in specially favorable circumstances,
as, for example, in the ancient Egyptian tombs. With the disuse of
papyrus-paper ceased also the ancient form of the roll. All
manuscripts written on parchment are in the form of books with
leaves. From about the eleventh century, paper made from cotton or
linen came into common use.</p>
<p>The costliness of writing materials gave rise to a peculiar
usage. From the leaves of an ancient work the original writing was
erased, more or less perfectly. They were then employed as the
material for another work, the latter being written over the
former. Such manuscripts are called
<i>palimpsests</i>&mdash;<i>written again</i> after erasure. The
original writing, which is very often the sacred text, can in
general be deciphered, especially by the aid of certain chemical
applications. Some of our most precious manuscripts are of this
character.</p>
<p>The existing manuscripts of the New Testament are of two kinds.
<i>First</i>, the <i>uncial</i>, that is, those written in capital
letters. Here belong all the most ancient and valuable. The writing
is generally in columns, from two to four to a page; sometimes in a
single column. There is no division of the text into words; the
marks of interpunction are few and simple; and till the seventh
century there were no accents, and breathings only in special
cases. <i>Secondly</i>, the <i>cursive</i>, or those written in
running-hand, with division of the text into words, capitals only
for initial letters, accents, breathings, etc., and often with many
contractions. This is the common form of manuscripts after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>{61}</span>
the tenth century, the uncial being retained for some ages
afterwards only in books designed for use in the church service. In
both the uncial and the cursive manuscripts, each century has its
peculiar style of writing. From this, as well as from the quality
of the materials, expert judges can determine the age of a given
manuscript with a good degree of accuracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The details pertaining to the form of ancient manuscripts, their
number, character, etc., belong to the department of textual
criticism. The above brief notices are given to prepare the way for
a statement of the evidence that we have the gospel narratives, as
also the other books of the New Testament, without corruption in
the form in which they were originally written. <i>See the PLATES
at the beginning of this book.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Of the autograph manuscripts proceeding immediately from the
inspired authors we find no trace after the apostolic age. Here, as
elsewhere, the wisdom of God has carefully guarded the church
against a superstitious veneration for the merely outward
instruments of redemption. We do not need the wood of the true
cross that we may have redemption through the blood of Christ; nor
do we need the identical manuscripts that proceeded from the
apostles and their companions, since we have the contents of these
manuscripts handed down to us without corruption in any essential
particular. This appears from various considerations.</p>
<p><i>First.</i> Several hundred manuscripts of the gospels, or of
portions of them, (to confine our attention at present to these,)
have been examined, two of them belonging to the fourth century and
two, with some fragments, to the fifth. All these, though written
in different centuries and coming from widely different regions,
contain essentially the same text. In them, not one of the great
facts or doctrines of the gospel history is mutilated or
obscured.</p>
<p><i>Secondly.</i> The quotations of the church fathers from the
last part of the second to the end of the fourth century are so
copious, that from them almost the entire text of our present
gospels could be reconstructed. These quotations agree
substantially <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id=
"page62"></a>{62}</span> with each other and with the text of our
existing manuscripts; only that the earlier fathers, as already
noticed, chap. 2. 3, often quote loosely from memory, blend
together different narratives, and interweave with the words of
Scripture their own explanatory remarks.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly.</i> We have two <i>versions</i> of the New
Testament&mdash;the Old Latin or Italic, and the Syriac called
Peshito&mdash;which learned men are agreed in placing somewhere in
the last half of the second century. The testimony of these
witnesses to the uncorrupt preservation of the sacred text, from
the time when they first appeared to the present, is decisive; for
they also agree essentially with the Greek text of the gospel as we
now possess it. Nor is this all. Davidson affirms of the Old Latin
version, that "the more ancient the Greek manuscripts, the closer
is their agreement with it." And Tischendorf says of the oldest
known manuscript of the Bible&mdash;the Greek Sinai Codex, brought
by him from the convent of St. Catharine, Mount Sinai, in
1859&mdash;that its agreement, in the New Testament portion, with
the Old Latin version, is remarkable. Through the joint testimony,
then, on the one hand, of the most ancient Greek manuscripts,
especially the Sinai Codex, which is the oldest of them all; and on
the other, of the Old Latin version which belongs to the last half
of the second century, we are carried back to a very ancient and
pure form of the Greek text prevalent before the execution of this
version, that is, about the middle of the second century.
Tischendorf adds arguments to show that the Syriac Peshito version,
the text of which has not come down to us in so pure a state, had
for its basis substantially the same form of text as the Old Latin
and the Sinai Codex.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The substantial identity of the sacred text, as we now have it,
with that which has existed since about the middle of the second
century, is thus shown to be a matter not of probable conjecture,
but of certain knowledge. Here, then, we have a sure criterion by
which to measure and interpret the complaints which textual
critics, ancient or modern, have made, sometimes in very strong
language, concerning the corruptions that have found <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>{63}</span> their way
into the text of the New Testament. These writers have reference to
what are called "various readings," not to mutilations and
alterations, such as those charged by the ancients upon Marcion, by
which he sought to change the facts and doctrines of the gospel.
That this must be their meaning we know; for there are the
manuscripts by hundreds as witnesses, all of which, the most
corrupt as textual critics would call them, as well as the purest,
give in the gospel narratives the same facts and doctrines without
essential variation.</p>
<p>Let not the inexperienced inquirer be misled into any wrong
conclusion by the number of "various readings," amounting to many
thousands, which textual criticism has brought to light. The
greater the number of manuscripts collated, the greater will be the
number of these readings; while, at the same time, we are
continually making a nearer approach to the purity of the primitive
text. As a general rule these variations relate to trifling
particulars; as, for example, whether the conjunction <i>and</i>
shall be inserted or omitted; whether <i>but</i> or <i>for</i> is
the true reading; whether this or that order of words giving the
same sense shall have the preference, etc. A few of the variations
are of a more important character. Thus, in John 1:18, some
manuscripts and fathers instead of <i>only begotten Son</i>, read
<i>only begotten God</i>. But even here we may decide either way
without changing or obscuring the great truths of the gospel
narratives; for these are not dependent on particular words or
phrases, but pervade and vivify the New Testament, as the vital
blood does the body. The same may be said of certain passages
which, on purely critical grounds&mdash;that is, the authority of
ancient manuscripts&mdash;some have thought doubtful; as, for
example, John 5:4, and the narrative recorded in the beginning of
the eighth chapter of the same gospel. The insertion or omission of
the passages concerning which any reasonable doubts can be
entertained on critical grounds, will not affect in the least the
great truths of the gospel narratives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. But it may be asked, Was the text from which the Old Latin
version was made, and with which, as we have seen, the oldest
manuscripts have a close agreement, substantially the same as that
which proceeded from the inspired authors? Here we must discard all
groundless suppositions, and adhere strictly to the known facts in
the premises.</p>
<p>The first fact to be noticed is the public reading of the
gospels in the Christian churches, a custom which prevailed from
the earliest times. Justin Martyr, writing before the middle of the
second century, says of the memoirs written by the apostles or
their followers and called gospels (which have been <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>{64}</span> shown to be
our canonical gospels, chap. 2:7) that either these or the writings
of the Jewish prophets were read in the Christian churches on the
first day of every week. This is a fact of the highest importance;
for it shows that the witnesses and guardians of the sacred text
were not a few individuals, but the great body of believers, and
that no systematic corruption of their contents could have taken
place without their knowledge and consent, which would never have
been given.</p>
<p>Intimately connected with the above is a second fact, that of
the great multiplication of copies of the books of the New
Testament, especially of the gospel narratives, since these contain
the great facts that lie at the foundation of the Christian system.
Every church would, as a matter of course, be anxious to possess a
copy, and Christians who possessed the requisite means would
furnish themselves with additional copies for their own private
use. If, now, we suppose one or more of these copies to have been
essentially changed, the corruption would not, as in the case of a
printed work, extend to many hundreds of copies. It would be
confined to the manuscript or manuscripts into which it had been
introduced and the copies made therefrom, while the numerous
uncorrupt copies would remain as witnesses of the fraud; for the
supposition of a very early corruption during the apostolic age,
before copies of the gospels had been to any considerable extent
multiplied, is utterly absurd.</p>
<p>A third fact is the high value attached by the primitive
churches to the gospel narratives, and their consequent zeal for
their uncorrupt preservation. No one will deny to them the
qualities of earnestness and sincerity. To them the gospels were
the record of their redemption through the blood of Christ. For the
truths contained in them they steadfastly endured persecution in
every form, and death itself. Could we even suppose, contrary to
evidence, that private transcribers altered at pleasure their
copies of the gospels, it is certain that the churches would never
have allowed their public copies to be tampered with. The
resistance which Marcion met with in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span> his attempt to alter the
sacred text, shows how watchful was their jealousy for its
uncorrupt preservation.</p>
<p>A still further fact is the want of time for essential
corruptions, like those now under consideration. That such
corruptions could have taken place during the apostolic age, no one
will maintain. Equally certain is it that they could not have
happened during the age next succeeding, while many presbyters and
private Christians yet survived who had listened to the apostles,
and knew the history of the gospels written by them or their
companions. But this brings us down into the first part of the
second century.</p>
<p>Leaving out of view the apostle John, who probably died near the
close of the first century, and assuming the martyrdom of Peter and
Paul to have taken place somewhere between A.D. 64 and 67, we may
place the beginning of the age now under consideration at A.D. 65.
Of the numerous Christians who were then thirty years or less of
age many must have survived till A.D. 110, and even later.
Polycarp, a disciple of John, suffered martyrdom A.D. 167, and
doubtless many others of his hearers survived till the middle of
the second century. The time, then, during which such a corruption
as that now under consideration can be supposed to have taken place
is so narrowed down that it amounts to well-nigh nothing; and it
is, moreover, the very time during which Justin Martyr wrote his
Apologies, and Marcion made his unsuccessful attempt to mutilate
the gospel history.</p>
<p>Finally, no evidence exists that the text of the gospel
narratives has been essentially corrupted. Of Marcion's abortive
attempt we have abundant notices in the writings of the early
fathers. Their silence in respect to other like attempts is
conclusive proof that they were never made. Had we the autographs
of the evangelists, we should, with reason, attach to them a high
value; but there is no ground for supposing that their text would
differ in any essential particular from that which we now possess.
They would present to our view the same Saviour and the same
gospel.</p>
<p>5. What has been said respecting the uncorrupt preservation of
the gospel narratives applies essentially to the other books of the
New Testament; so that in the consideration of them the above
arguments will not need to be repeated.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>{66}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>AUTHENTICITY AND CREDIBILITY OF THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES.</h3>
<p>1. The genuineness and uncorrupt preservation of our four
canonical gospels having been established, the presumption in favor
of their authenticity and credibility is exceedingly strong. In
truth, few can be found who, admitting their apostolic origin in
essentially their present form, will venture to deny that they
contain an authentic and reliable record of facts. We may dismiss
at once the modern theory which converts the gospels into
myths&mdash;pure ideas embodied in allegorical narratives which
have no historic foundation. Myths do not turn the world upside
down, as did the preaching of Christ and his apostles. Myths do not
inspire the souls of men and women by thousands and tens of
thousands with heroic zeal and courage, enabling them steadfastly
to endure persecution and death for the truth's sake. It was love
towards a crucified and risen Saviour in deed and in truth, not
towards the mythical idea of such a Saviour, that made the
primitive Christians victorious alike over inward sinful affection
and outward persecution. To every one who reads the gospel
narratives in the exercise of his sober judgment, it is manifest
that they are intended to be plain unvarnished statements of facts.
The question is, Are these statements reliable? Here new arguments
can hardly be expected; the old are abundantly sufficient.
Reserving for another place those general arguments which apply to
the gospel system as a whole, let us here briefly consider the
character of the authors and their records; of the events which
they record with the surrounding circumstances; and especially of
Jesus, their great theme.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>{67}</span>
<p>2. It is natural to ask, in the first place, Were these men
<i>sincere and truthful</i>? Here we need not long delay. Their
sincerity, with that of their contemporaries who received their
narratives as true, shines forth like the sun in the firmament.
With reference to them, the Saviour's argument applies in all its
force: "How can Satan cast out Satan?" "If Satan rise up against
himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end." The
life-long work of the evangelists and their associates was to cast
out of the world all fraud and falsehood. If now they attempted to
do this by the perpetration of a most astounding fraud, we have the
case of Satan casting out Satan. But we need not argue the matter
at length. By what they did and suffered in behalf of their
doctrines, as well as by the artless simplicity of their
narratives, they give full proof of their sincerity and
truthfulness.</p>
<p>3. We next inquire: Were they <i>competent as men</i>? that is,
were they men of sober judgment, able correctly to see and record
the facts that came under their observation, and not visionary
enthusiasts who mistook dreams for realities? This question admits
of a short and satisfactory answer. No proof whatever exists that
they were visionary men, but abundant proof to the contrary. Their
narratives are calm, unimpassioned, and straightforward, without
expatiation on the greatness of Christ's character and works and
the wickedness of his enemies, as is the way of all excited
enthusiasts. What Paul said to Festus applies in its full force to
them and their writings: "I am not mad, most noble Festus, but
speak forth the words of truth and soberness." If any one will
condemn them as visionary, it must be on the sole ground that all
belief in the supernatural is visionary&mdash;a position that will
be noticed hereafter.</p>
<p>4. A further inquiry is, Were these men <i>competent as
witnesses</i>? that is, had they the requisite means of knowing the
facts which they record? With regard to the apostles Matthew and
John, this matter need not be argued. With regard to the other two,
Luke states very fairly the position which they occupied:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>{68}</span>
"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all
things," ("having accurately traced out all things," as the
original signifies,) "from the very beginning, to write to thee, in
order," etc. Luke had in abundance the means of accurately tracing
out all things relating to our Lord's life and works, for he was
the companion of apostles and others who "from the beginning were
eye-witnesses and ministers of the word;" and from them, according
to his own statement, he drew his information. The same is true of
Mark also.</p>
<p>5. We come now to consider the <i>character of the works</i>
which they record, and the circumstances in which they were
performed. Here it may be remarked in the outset that it is not
necessary to examine in detail all the miracles recorded in the
gospel history. Though they all proceeded alike from the direct
agency of God, they are not all alike open to human inspection. If
upon examination we find the supernatural origin of many of them
raised above all possibility of doubt, it is a legitimate inference
that the rest of them had the same divine origin. Not to insist
then upon the miracles ascribed to our Lord within the sphere of
inanimate nature, such as the conversion of water into wine, the
feeding of many thousands with a few loaves and fishes, and walking
upon the sea, all of which were done in such circumstances that
there is no room for questioning their reality, let us examine some
that were performed upon the persons of men. Palsy, dropsy,
withered limbs, blindness, the want of hearing and speech, leprosy,
confirmed lunacy&mdash;all these were as well known in their
outward symptoms eighteen hundred years ago as they are to-day.
Persons could not be afflicted with such maladies in a corner. The
neighbors must have known then, as they do now, the particulars of
such cases, and have been unexceptionable witnesses to their
reality. Persons may feign blindness and other infirmities among
strangers, but no man can pass himself off as palsied, deaf and
dumb, blind, (especially blind from birth,) halt, withered, in his
own community. The reality of the maladies then is beyond all
question; and so is also the reality of their <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>{69}</span>
instantaneous removal by the immediate power of the Saviour. Here
we must not fail to take into account the immense number of our
Lord's miracles, their diversified character, and the fact that
they were performed everywhere, as well without as with previous
notice, and in the most open and public manner. Modern pretenders
to miraculous power have a select circle of marvellous feats, the
exhibition of which is restricted to particular places. No one of
them would venture to undertake the cure of a man born blind, or
that had a withered limb, or that had been a paralytic for
thirty-eight years. But Jesus of Nazareth went about the cities and
villages of Judea for the space of three years, healing all manner
of disease. With him there was no distinction of easy and
difficult, since to Divine power nothing is hard. With the same
word he rebuked a raging fever, cleansed from leprosy, gave
strength to the paralytic, healed the withered limb, gave sight to
the blind, hearing to the deaf, and speech to the dumb, and raised
the dead to life. The same voice that said to the man at Bethesda,
"Rise, take up thy bed, and walk," said also to Lazarus, who had
lain four days in the grave, "Come forth."</p>
<p>6. It is with reason that we lay special stress upon the fact
that Christ performed many of his greatest miracles in the presence
of his enemies, who had both the means and the will to institute a
searching investigation concerning them, and who would have denied
their reality had it been in their power to do so. Sad indeed is
the record of the perverse opposition and calumny which our Lord
encountered on the part of the Jewish rulers. But even this has a
bright side. It shows us that the Saviour's miracles could endure
the severest scrutiny&mdash;that after every means which power and
wealth and patronage and official influence could command had been
used for their disparagement, their divine origin still shone forth
like the unclouded sun at noon-day. If any one doubts this, let him
read attentively the ninth chapter of John's gospel, which records
the investigation instituted by the Jewish rulers respecting the
miracle of healing a man blind from his birth. In no <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>{70}</span> modern court
of justice was a question of fact ever subjected to a severer
scrutiny. And the result was that they could not deny the miracle,
but said in their blind hatred of the Redeemer, "Give God the
praise: we know that this man is a sinner." So when they could not
deny that Jesus cast out devils, they alleged that he did it by the
help of Satan; when it was manifest that he had by a word healed a
man that had lain thirty-and-eight years a helpless paralytic, they
blamed him for working on the Sabbath-day; when Lazarus had been
called out of his grave in the presence of all the people, they
said, "What do we? for this man doeth many miracles." And then they
consulted not to disprove these miracles, but to put both him and
Lazarus to death. Thus, in the good providence of God, we have for
the reality of our Lord's miracles the testimony of his enemies and
persecutors.</p>
<p>7. The <i>resurrection</i> of Jesus is the miracle of miracles,
of which we may say with truth that it comprehends in itself all
the other mighty works recorded in the gospel history. We cannot
but notice the condescending care with which our Lord himself
certified to his disciples its reality. When he had suddenly
appeared in the midst of them, "they were terrified and affrighted,
and supposed that they had seen a spirit." To convince them of the
reality of his bodily presence, he said, "Behold my hands and my
feet, that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he
showed them his hands and his feet," that they might see in them
the prints of the nails. Finding them still incredulous, "believing
not for joy and wondering," he added another conclusive proof that
he was not a spirit, but a true man: he asked for meat; "and they
gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb; and he
took it, and did eat before them." Luke 24:36-43. To the
unbelieving Thomas he offered the further proof which he had
demanded: "Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach
hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless,
but believing." The certainty of this great event <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>{71}</span> the
evangelist Luke sets forth in his introduction to the Acts of the
Apostles: "To whom also," (to the apostles,) "he showed himself
alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen of
them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the
kingdom of God." The apostle Peter, in his address to Cornelius and
his friends, says: "Him God raised up the third day, and showed him
openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of
God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from
the dead." Acts 10:40, 41. The apostle Paul, in his enumeration of
our Lord's appearances to his disciples after his resurrection, 1
Cor. 5-8, mentions that on one occasion "he was seen of above five
hundred brethren at once; of whom," he says, "the greater part
remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."</p>
<p>It was not the greatness of the miracle, considered simply by
itself, but its relation to the gospel, that made our Lord's
resurrection from the dead the central fact of the apostles'
testimony. It was, so to speak, the hinge on which the whole work
of redemption turned. Our Lord's expiatory death for the sins of
the world and his resurrection from the dead were both alike parts
of one indivisible whole. It was not his claim to be the promised
Messiah alone that was involved in the fact of his resurrection.
His completion, as the Messiah, of the work of man's redemption was
also dependent on that great event. "If Christ be not risen," says
the apostle, "then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also
vain;" and again, "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye
are yet in your sins." 1 Cor. 15:14, 17. We need not wonder then
that the apostles, in their testimony to the people, insisted so
earnestly on this one great fact in our Lord's history; for by it
God sealed him as the Prince of life.</p>
<p>8. The <i>character of Jesus</i> of Nazareth, as drawn by the
four evangelists, is the highest possible proof of the authenticity
and credibility of the gospel narratives. Of this it has been
justly said, "The character is possible to be conceived, because it
was actualized in a living example." (Nature and the Supernatural,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>{72}</span>
p. 324.) The inapproachable excellence of Christ's character places
it high above all human praise. The reverent mind shrinks
instinctively from the idea of attempting to eulogize it, as from
something profane and presumptuous. We do not eulogize the sun
shining in his strength, but we put a screen over our eyes when we
would look at him, lest we should be blinded by the brightness of
his beams. So must every man look at Jesus of Nazareth with
reverence and awe, who has any true sense of what is great and
excellent. What is now to be said of this character is not eulogy.
It is part of an argument for the reality of the events recorded in
the gospel history. Here it is important to notice not only the
character itself, but the manner of the portraiture, and its power
over the human heart.</p>
<p>The character of Jesus is perfectly <i>original</i>. Nothing
like it was ever conceived of by the loftiest minds of antiquity.
Nothing like it has appeared since his day, in actual life, or even
in the conceptions of the most gifted writers. As there is one sun
in the firmament, so there is one Jesus Christ in the history of
the world. His character has a <i>human</i> and a <i>divine</i>
element; and these two interpenetrate each other, so as to
constitute together one indivisible and glorious whole. Jesus could
not be, even in idea, what he is as man, unless he were God also.
And what he is as God, he is as God made flesh, and dwelling as man
among men. It is the <i>God-man</i> which the gospel narratives
present to us. If we consider the qualities which belong to our
Saviour as man, we notice the union in full measure and just
proportion of all those qualities which belong to perfect humanity.
In the case of mere men, the abundant possession of one quality
implies almost of necessity deficiency elsewhere, and consequently
one-sidedness of character. Not so in the case of Jesus. He has all
the attributes of a perfect man in perfect fulness and in perfect
harmony with each other. Let us reverently look at some
particulars.</p>
<p>His character unites the deepest <i>tranquillity</i> with the
deepest <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id=
"page73"></a>{73}</span> <i>fervor</i> of spirit. Our Lord's
tranquillity shines forth through the whole course of his ministry,
and manifests itself alike in great things and small. It is evident
to all who read the narratives of the evangelists that he performed
his mighty works as one conscious that divine power belonged to him
of right, and that the exercise of it, even in its highest forms,
was nothing new nor strange. In connection with his greatest
miracles he calmly gave directions, as if they had been ordinary
occurrences. When he had fed many thousands with a few loaves and
fishes, he said, "Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing
be lost." When he had raised from the dead the daughter of Jairus,
"he commanded that something should be given her to eat." When he
had called out of the grave one who had lain there four days, he
directed, "Loose him and let him go." Even in Gethsemane, when
oppressed with agony too great for human endurance, his
self-possession remained as perfect as his submission to his
Father's will. That his serenity never left him for a moment during
the process of his arrest, trial, sentence, and lingering death on
the cross, is a truth which shines forth from the sacred narrative
as his own raiment did on the mount of transfiguration, "white and
glistering." Any attempt to describe it would be but mockery. And
yet this deep composure of spirit is not that of indifference or of
a cold temperament. It is the composure of one in whose bosom burns
a steady and intense flame of zeal for the glory of God and good
will towards men, by which he is borne forward with untiring energy
in the work committed to him from above. It is the composure of a
spirit whose depth of emotion none can measure.</p>
<p>We notice again the union in our Lord of perfect <i>wisdom</i>
with perfect <i>freedom from guile</i> and double dealing. That his
wisdom was never at fault all must admit. He was surrounded by
crafty adversaries, who contrived all manner of plans to entangle
him in his talk. Yet in the twinkling of an eye he turned their
wiles against themselves, and they found themselves taken in their
own net. Meanwhile he always pursued <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page74" id="page74"></a>{74}</span> the straightforward course of
sincerity and truth. Not the slightest trace of deceit or cunning
artifice appeared in his ministry from first to last.</p>
<p>Closely allied to the above-named qualities are <i>prudence</i>
and <i>boldness</i>, both of which met in full measure in our
Lord's character. That he feared no man and shrank from no peril
when it was his duty to encounter it, is too obvious to be insisted
on. Yet he never needlessly encountered opposition and danger. He
was never bold for the purpose of making a show of boldness. When
the Jews sought to kill him, he "walked in Galilee" to avoid their
enmity. When his brethren went up to the feast in Jerusalem, he
would not go up with them, but afterwards went up, "not openly, but
as it were in secret." When, at a later day, after the resurrection
of Lazarus, the Jews sought his life, he "walked no more openly
among the Jews; but went thence into a country near to the
wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with
his disciples." Not until the time had come that he should die for
the sins of the world did he expose himself to the rage of his
enemies; and then he went boldly into Jerusalem at the head of his
disciples. His own precept, "Be ye wise as serpents and harmless as
doves," he perfectly exemplified throughout his ministry.</p>
<p>We cannot but notice once more the union in our Lord's character
of the greatest <i>tenderness</i> with unbending <i>severity</i>
whenever the cause of truth demanded severity. He opened his
ministry at Nazareth by reading from the prophet Isaiah a
portraiture of his own character: "The Spirit of the Lord God is
upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the
poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind,
to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable
year of the Lord." Isa. 61:1, 2. The execution of this mission
required a tender and forbearing spirit, that would not break the
bruised reed or quench the smoking flax; and such was the spirit of
his whole ministry. For the penitent, though publicans and sinners,
he had only words of kindness. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span> Towards the infirmities and
mistakes of his sincere disciples he was wonderfully forbearing.
When a strife had arisen among the apostles which of them should be
the greatest, instead of denouncing in severe terms their foolish
ambition, he called to himself a little child and set him in the
midst, and from him gave them a lesson on the duty of humility. Yet
this tender and compassionate Jesus of Nazareth, who took little
children in his arms and blessed them, who stood and cried, "Come
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you
rest," and who wept at the grave of Lazarus&mdash;this same Jesus
could say to Peter when he would deter Him from the path of duty,
"Get thee behind me, Satan!" and could denounce in the presence of
all the people the scribes and Pharisees who sat in Moses' seat. In
truth, the most severe denunciations of hypocrisy and wickedness
contained in the New Testament and the most awful descriptions of
the future punishment of the impenitent fell from our Saviour's
lips. In his tenderness there was no element of weakness.</p>
<p>Our Lord's perfect <i>meekness and humility</i> need no human
comment. They shine forth with serene brightness through all his
words and actions. He described himself as "meek and lowly in
heart," and his life was a perpetual illustration of these
qualities. "When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he
suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that
judgeth righteously." But the point to be particularly noticed is
the wonderful harmony of this meek and lowly mind with
<i>claims</i> more <i>lofty</i> than were ever conceived of by any
man before him&mdash;claims everywhere boldly asserted, and which,
as we shall see hereafter, implied the possession of a divine
nature. It is not that he claimed and exercised power over nature
or outward power over men, even power to raise the dead, that fills
us with awe and amazement; but that he went within the spirit, and
offered inward life, light, strength, peace&mdash;in a word, life
eternal&mdash;to all who would come to him; and that he asserted,
in a way as decisive as it was calm, his absolute control over the
everlasting destinies of all men. When we read the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>{76}</span> account of
these superhuman claims, we have no feeling that they were
incongruous or extravagant. On the contrary, they seem to us
altogether legitimate and proper. And yet, as has been often
remarked, were any other person to advance a tithe of these
pretensions, he would be justly regarded as a madman. The only
possible explanation is, that this meek and lowly Jesus made good
his claim to be the Son of God by what he was and by what he
did.</p>
<p>Another quality very conspicuous in our Lord's character is his
perfect <i>elevation above this world</i>. "Ye are from beneath,"
said he to the Jews; "I am from above: ye are of this world; I am
not of this world." It was not in his origin alone, but in his
spirit also that he was from above. As he was from heaven, so was
he heavenly in all his affections. His own precept to his
disciples, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, but lay
up for yourselves treasures in heaven," was the law of his own
life. He had no treasures here below but the souls of men; and
these are not earthly, but heavenly treasures. Satan plied him in
vain with the offer of "all the kingdoms of the world, and the
glory of them." In him "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life" could find no place for a single
moment. He kept the world always and perfectly under his feet. Yet
this perfect elevation above the world had in it no tinge of
<i>stoicism</i> or <i>asceticism</i>. He made no war upon the
genuine passions and affections of human nature, but simply
subjected them all to his higher spiritual nature; in other words
to the law of God. Except temporarily for meditation and prayer, he
never withdrew himself, nor encouraged his disciples to withdraw
themselves from the cares and temptations of an active life, under
the false idea of thus rising to a state of superhuman communion
with God. He did not fast himself systematically, nor enjoin upon
his disciples systematic fastings, but left fastings for special
emergencies. In a word, he ate and drank like other men. His
heavenly mind lay not in the renunciation of God's gifts, but in
maintaining his affections constantly raised above the gifts
themselves to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id=
"page77"></a>{77}</span> the divine Giver. It took on a human, and
therefore an imitable form.</p>
<p>And what shall we say of our Lord's spotless <i>purity</i> of
heart and life? We cannot eulogize it, for it is above all human
praise. But we can refresh the eyes of our understanding by gazing
upon it, as upon a glorious sun, until we feel its vivifying and
transforming power in our own souls.</p>
<p>In contemplating the above qualities, it is of the highest
importance to notice that, though they exist in such fulness and
perfection, they are yet human, and therefore imitable. They are
not the virtues of an angel in heaven, or of a king on the throne,
or of a philosopher in his school, or of a monk in his cell; but of
a man moving among men in the sphere of common life, and filling
out common life with all the duties appropriate to it. His example
then is available for the imitation of the lowest not less than the
highest. It offers itself to all classes of men as a model of all
that is good in human nature. We may boldly affirm that such a
character as this could never have been conceived of, if it had not
actually existed.</p>
<hr />
<p>If now we look at our Lord's <i>character as a teacher</i>, we
find it equally original and wonderful. Writers on the gospel
history have with reason laid great stress on the fact that he
stood high above the errors and prejudices, not only of his own age
and nation, but of all ages and nations. He saw intuitively and
perfectly what God is, what man is, and what are man's relations to
God and to his fellow-men; and was therefore able to establish a
religion for men, as men, that needs no change for any age, or
nation, or condition of life. He has sometimes been called a
"Galilean peasant." The phrase sounds unpleasantly in the ears of
those who adore him as their divine Lord and Master. Nevertheless
it is in an important sense true. He was educated among the common
people of Galilee, and had no special human training. It was an age
of narrowness and formalism. The scribes and Pharisees, who sat in
Moses' seat, had covered up the true meaning and spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>{78}</span>
of the Old Testament beneath a mass of human traditions that
substituted "mint, and anise, and cummin" for "the weightier
matters of the law." Yet in such an age Jesus came forth a perfect
teacher of divine truth. He swept away at once the glosses of the
Jewish doctors, unfolded to the people the true meaning of the law
and the prophets as preparatory to his coming, and gave to the
world a religion that meets the wants of all classes and conditions
of men in all ages and nations. Considered as the good leaven which
Christ cast into the lump of humanity, the gospel has continual
progress. But considered as the plan of salvation which he
revealed, it cannot have progress, for it is perfect. It needs no
amendment or change, that it may be adapted to our age or any other
age. As air and water and light meet the wants of all men in all
ages, so the gospel, when freed from human additions and received
in its original purity, is all that fallen humanity needs. Here is
a great fact to be explained. The only reasonable explanation is
that given by the Saviour himself. When the Jews marvelled at his
teaching, saying, "How knoweth this man letters, having never
learned?" he answered, "My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent
me." Such a religion as that described in the gospels could not
have been conceived of unless it had actually existed; and it could
not have existed without God for its author. Gifted men may be in
advance of their own age; that is, they may see before others what
is the next thing indicated by the present progress of society. But
mere men do not rise at once above all the errors and prejudices by
which they are surrounded into the region of pure light and truth.
All the work that men do is imperfect, and needs emendation by
those who come after them. A religion that remains from age to age
as perfectly adapted to the wants of all men as it was at the
beginning, must be from God, not from man.</p>
<p>Our Saviour's <i>manner of teaching</i> was also as original as
the teaching itself. He saw through the world of nature and mind at
a glance, and it stood always ready at hand to furnish him with
arguments and illustrations&mdash;arguments and illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>{79}</span>
as simple and natural as they were profound, and by means of which
he unfolded the deepest truths in the plainest and most
intelligible forms. Take, for example, the parables of the
mustard-seed and the leaven. They contain within themselves the
whole history of Christ's kingdom in its inward principle. They
unfold views of its steady progress from age to age, as a growth
from an inward vital force, on which the most philosophical minds
especially love to dwell; and yet they are perfectly intelligible
to the most unlettered man. To teach by parables, without any false
analogies, and in a way that interested and instructed alike the
learned and the ignorant, this was a wonderful characteristic of
our Lord's ministry. In this respect no one of his apostles, not
even the bosom disciple, attempted to imitate him. Yet in the great
fact that his teaching was not for a select few, but for the masses
of mankind, so that "the common people heard him gladly," all his
servants can and ought to imitate him.</p>
<p>Thus far we have considered mainly the human side of our Lord's
character, though through it all his divinity shines forth. Let us
now look more particularly at <i>his divine mission and
character</i>. On the fact that his mission was from God we need
not dwell. Nicodemus expressed the judgment of every candid mind
when he said, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from
God; for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God
be with him." If there is one truth which our Lord asserted more
frequently than any other, it is that he came from God: "The works
which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do,
bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me." "If God were
your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from
God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."</p>
<p>But Jesus had not only a divine mission, but a <i>divine
person</i> also; and the manner in which he manifested his divinity
is, if possible, more original than any thing else in his history,
and bears in itself the impress of reality. A company of men who
should attempt to give a portraiture of a divine being <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>{80}</span> simply from
their own conceptions would doubtless put into his lips many direct
assertions of his deity, and make his life abound in stupendous
miracles. But it is not in any such crude way that our Saviour's
divinity manifests itself in the gospel narratives. It is true
indeed that in the manner of his miracles he everywhere makes the
impression that he performs them by virtue of a power residing in
himself; that while the <i>commission</i> to do them comes from the
Father, the <i>power</i> to do them belongs to his own person. In
this respect the contrast is very sharp between his manner and that
of the prophets before him and the apostles after him. In their
case the power, as well as the commission, was wholly from God, as
they were careful to teach the people: "In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, rise up and walk." "Why look ye so earnestly on us, as
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"
"His name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong,
whom ye see and know." "Eneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole." But
not to dwell on this, let us look at some very remarkable ways in
which our Saviour manifested his divine nature.</p>
<p>He called <i>God his Father</i> in a peculiar and incommunicable
sense. He never said, "Our Father," by which he would have classed
himself with other men, but always, "My Father," showing that thus
he stood alone in his relation to God. As the son has the same
nature with the father, and when acting under his authority, the
same prerogatives also; so Jesus, as the Son of God, claimed the
power and right to do whatever his Father did, and to receive the
same honor as his Father: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
This the Jews rightly understood to be an assertion of equality
with the Father; for they "sought the more to kill him, because he
not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was his own
Father, (so the original reads,) making himself equal with God." To
this the Saviour answered: "The Son can do nothing of
himself"&mdash;acting in his own name, and without the concurrence
of the Father's will&mdash;"but what he seeth the Father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>{81}</span>
do; for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son
likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things
that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these,
that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and
quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. For the
Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the
Son: that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the
Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father which
hath sent him." John 5:17-23. Here the Son, though acting under the
Father's commission, claims equality with the Father; for without
this he could neither share all the Father's counsels, nor do all
the Father's works, nor receive from the Father authority to judge
all men&mdash;an office which plainly implies omniscience&mdash;nor
be entitled to the same honor as the Father. The point to be
especially noticed in the present connection is the originality of
the way in which our Lord here asserts his divine nature. We cannot
for a moment suppose that such a way would have occurred to one who
was writing from his own invention. The only possible explanation
of the existence of such a passage in the gospel of John, (and the
same is true of many other passages,) is that it is a true record
of what actually took place in our Lord's history.</p>
<p>Again: our Lord represents himself as the source of <i>light and
life</i> to all mankind. To the Jews he said: "I am the light of
the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but
shall have the light of life." John 8:12. In comparison with what
he here claims for himself, the outward work of opening men's
bodily eyes dwindles into nothing. That was only the seal of his
divine mission. But in these and other like words, he does, as it
were, draw aside the veil of his humanity, and give us a glimpse of
the glory of the Godhead that dwells within. So too he says, "I am
the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of
this bread he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give
is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." John
6:51. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id=
"page82"></a>{82}</span> The resurrection of Lazarus, stupendous as
that miracle was, does not fill us with such awe and amazement as
the mighty words which he uttered to Martha: "I am the resurrection
and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live: and whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall
never die," John 11:25, 26; for in these words he represents
himself as being to the whole human family the author of all life,
natural, spiritual, and eternal. He connects the particular act of
giving life which he is about to perform with the final
resurrection, "when all that are in the graves shall hear his
voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation." John 5:28, 29. These utterances, so
calm, so lofty, so original, do not sound like the inventions of
man. They wear a heavenly costume. When we read them, we feel that
the only explanation of their existence in the gospel narrative is
the fact that they were actually uttered by our Lord.</p>
<p>And the same is true of another kindred class of passages, in
which the Saviour asserts his <i>inward dominion over the human
spirit</i>. Hear him, as he stands and proclaims: "Come unto me,
all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
Matt. 11:28. "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not
as the world giveth, give I unto you." John 14:27. The world gives
peace at best outwardly, and often only in empty words; but Jesus
has direct access to the inmost fountains of feeling. He gives
peace inwardly and efficaciously. When he turned into songs of joy
the tears of the widow of Nain by raising her son to life, that was
a wonderful instance of his giving peace; but far greater and more
glorious is the work when, by his inward presence in the soul, he
makes it victorious over all "the sufferings of this present time."
This is what he meant when he said to his disciples: "These things
have I spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In the world
ye shall have tribulations; but be of good cheer: I have overcome
the world." John 16:33. In his name, apostles <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>{83}</span> raised the
dead to life; but no apostle&mdash;no mere man&mdash;would have
ventured to say, "In me ye shall have peace."</p>
<p>These last words naturally lead to the consideration of another
very peculiar form of speech first introduced by our Lord, and
passing from him to the church; that of the <i>mutual
indwelling</i> of himself and his disciples: "Abide in me, and I in
you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in
the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me." John 15:1-7. It
is a vital union of the believer's soul with Jesus, through which
he receives from Jesus life and fruitfulness, as the branch from
its union with the vine. Here is an assertion of deity. The Jews
regarded Moses with the highest reverence; but no one of them ever
spoke of abiding in Moses, or having Moses abiding in himself. Had
any Christian disciple represented himself as dwelling in Peter or
Paul, the apostle would have rent his clothes at the blasphemy of
the words.</p>
<p>Other peculiar ways in which our Lord manifested his deity could
be specified, but the above will suffice as examples. Let any
candid man consider all these examples in their connection, each of
them so original and so majestic, so simple and natural, and yet so
far removed from anything that could have occurred to one sitting
down to draw from his own imagination the picture of a divine
person; and he will be convinced that such a record as that
contained in our four canonical gospels was possible only because
it is a simple and truthful history of what Jesus of Nazareth was
and did. Plain men can give a straightforward account of what they
have seen or learned from eye-witnesses; but it transcends the
genius of any man to invent such narratives of such a character.
The gospel narratives are marked throughout by artless simplicity.
Each of the writers goes straightforward with his story, never
thinking for a moment of what his own genius is to accomplish, but
intent only on exhibiting his Lord and Master as the Saviour of the
world. The apostle John, in giving the design of his own gospel,
gives that also of the other evangelists: "And many other signs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span>
truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not
written in this book. But these are written, that ye might believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye
might have life through his name." John 20:30, 31.</p>
<p>And because this glorious and divine person is a living reality,
he possesses from age to age an undying power over the human heart.
Love towards him is the mightiest principle on earth, both for
doing and for suffering. It makes the soul of which it has taken
full possession invincible. When Jesus of Nazareth is enthroned in
the castle of the human heart, not all the powers of earth and hell
can overcome it. See farther, chap. 12:8.</p>
<p>9. Since, as we have seen, the gospel narratives are an
authentic record of facts, it follows that in the person and life
of Jesus of Nazareth we have a <i>supernatural revelation</i> from
God in the fullest sense of the words. That his origin was both
superhuman and supernatural, the gospels teach us in the most
explicit terms. He says of himself: "I came forth from the Father,
and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto
the Father." John 16:28. "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with
thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the
world was." John 17:5. That the appearance on earth of One who
dwelt with the Father in glory before the world was, and after the
fulfilment of his mission returned to the Father again, was
supernatural, is self-evident. His person was, as has been shown,
divine. He was God manifest in the flesh; and wherever he went, his
supernatural power displayed itself. The miraculous element is so
interwoven into the very substance of the gospel history, that
there is no possibility of setting it aside, except by rejecting
the history itself. It is the fashion with a certain class of
writers, after denying our Lord's divine nature and explaining away
his supernatural works, to be profuse in their eulogies of his
character. If they can first rid themselves of the obligation to
believe on him and obey him as their divine Lord, they are willing
to bestow upon him, as a man like themselves, the highest
commendations. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id=
"page85"></a>{85}</span> But the attempt is hopeless. What will
they do with the fact of his resurrection from the dead&mdash;the
most certain as well as the greatest miracle in his history, and
which includes in itself all the rest? Had Jesus not risen from the
dead, as he so often affirmed that he should, then he would have
been what the Jewish rulers called him&mdash;a deceiver, and no
Saviour; but since the miracle of his resurrection must be admitted
by all who do not reject the whole gospel history as a fable, why
deny the lesser miracles connected with his history? The assumption
that miracles are impossible can only go with the denial of God's
personality; and this, by whatever name it is called, is atheism.
If there is a personal God, who is before nature, above nature, and
the author of nature in its inmost essence, he can manifest himself
within the sphere of nature in a supernatural way, whenever he
chooses to do so. If God who made us cares for us, and is indeed
our Father in heaven, it is reasonable to suppose that he may
reveal himself to us in supernatural forms, when the end is our
deliverance from the bondage of sin, and our preparation for an
eternity of holiness and happiness. To deny this, would be to make
nature the highest end of God&mdash;to put the world of God's
intelligent creatures under nature, instead of making nature their
servant and minister.</p>
<p>10. The objections that have been urged against the gospel
history are of two kinds. The first class relates to its doctrines,
as, for example, that of demoniacal possessions, that of eternal
punishment, etc. To enlarge on this subject would be out of place
here. It is sufficient to say that the only reasonable rule is to
argue from the certainty of the record to the truth of the
doctrines in question. He who first assumes that a certain doctrine
cannot be true, and then, on the ground of this assumption, sets
aside a history sustained by overwhelming evidence, exalts his own
finite understanding to be the supreme rule of faith; and to him an
authoritative revelation becomes an impossibility. The second class
of objections relates to alleged contradictions and inconsistencies
between the different <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id=
"page86"></a>{86}</span> writers. The explanation and
reconciliation of these is the work of the harmonist. We need not
wait, however, for the result of his labors, that we may rest
confidently on the truth of the record. These apparent
disagreements do not affect a single doctrine or duty of
Christianity. They all relate to incidental matters, such as the
time and order of the events recorded, the accompanying
circumstances, etc. Had we all the missing links of the evangelical
history, we might reconcile all these differences; but without
them, it is not in all cases possible. Nor is it necessary; since,
where different writers record the same transactions, substantial
agreement, with diversity in respect to the details, is everywhere
the characteristic of authentic history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES AND THE ACKNOWLEDGED EPISTLES.</h3>
<p>1. The genuineness, uncorrupt preservation, and credibility of
the gospel narratives having been shown to rest on a firm
foundation, the principal part of our work is accomplished, so far
as the New Testament is concerned. We are prepared beforehand to
expect some record of the labors of the apostles, like that
contained in the Acts of the Apostles; and also discussions and
instructions relating to the doctrines and duties of Christianity,
such as we find in the apostolic epistles. Our Saviour established
his church only in its fundamental principles and ordinances. The
work of publishing his gospel and organizing churches among Jews
and Gentiles he committed to his apostles. Before his crucifixion
he taught them that the Holy Ghost could not come (that is, in his
special and full influences as the administrator of the new
covenant) till after his departure to the Father: "It is expedient
for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come unto you; but if I depart I will send him unto you." John
16:7. "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
the Father, even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the
Father, he shall testify of me. And ye also shall bear witness,
because ye have been with me from the beginning." John 15:26, 27.
Now we have, in the Acts of the Apostles, first an account of the
fulfilment by the Saviour of his promise that he would send the
Holy Ghost; then a record how the apostles, thus qualified, obeyed
the Saviour's command to preach the gospel to Jews and
Gentiles&mdash;a record not, indeed, complete, but sufficient to
show the manner and spirit in which the work <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span> was
performed. Some truths, moreover, of the highest importance the
Saviour gave only in outline, because the time for their full
revelation had not yet come. John 16:12, 13. Such were especially
the doctrine of his atoning sacrifice on Calvary with the connected
doctrine of justification by faith; and the divine purpose to
abolish the Mosaic economy, and with it the distinction between
Jews and Gentiles. We have, partly in the Acts and partly in the
epistles, an account of the unfolding of these great truths by the
apostles under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and of the
commotions and contentions that naturally accompanied this work.
The practical application of the gospel to the manifold relations
of life, domestic, social, and civil, with the solution of various
difficult questions arising therefrom, was another work necessarily
devolved on the apostles, and performed by them with divine wisdom
for the instruction of all coming ages. The book of Acts and the
epistles ascribed to the apostles being such a natural sequel to
the Redeemer's work, as recorded by the four evangelists, a briefer
statement of the evidence for their genuineness and authenticity
will be sufficient.</p>
<p>I. <i>The Acts of the Apostles.</i> 2. According to Chrysostom,
First Homily on Acts, this book was not so abundantly read by the
early Christians as the gospels. The explanation of this
comparative neglect is found in the fact that it is occupied with
the doings of the apostles, not of the Lord himself. Passing by
some uncertain allusions to the work in the writings of the
apostolic fathers, the first explicit quotation from it is
contained in the letter heretofore noticed, chap. 2:4, from the
churches of Vienne and Lyons in Gaul, written about A.D. 177, in
which they say: "Moreover they prayed, after the example of Stephen
the perfect martyr, for those who inflicted upon them cruel
torments, 'Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.'" Iren&aelig;us,
in the last part of the second century, Tertullian in the last part
of the same century and the beginning of the third, Clement of
Alexandria about the end of the second century and
onwards&mdash;all these bear explicit testimony to the book of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>{89}</span>
Acts, ascribing it to Luke as its author; and from their day onward
the notices of the work are abundant. We may add the concurrent
testimony of the Muratorian canon and the Syriac version, called
the Peshito, which belong to the last quarter of the second
century, and the still earlier testimony of the Old Latin version.
In a word, the book is placed by Eusebius among those that were
universally acknowledged by the churches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rejection of the book by certain heretical sects, as the
Ebionites, Marcionites, Manich&aelig;ans, etc., is of no weight, as
their objections rested not on historical, but on doctrinal
grounds. As to the statement of Photius that "some call Clement of
Rome the author, some Barnabas, and some Luke the evangelist," it
is to be remarked that he is giving not his own judgment, for he
expressly ascribes it to Luke, but the arbitrary opinions of
certain persons; and these are contradicted by the obvious fact
that the third gospel, which proceeded from the same hand as the
Acts of the Apostles, was never ascribed to any other person than
Luke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. The <i>internal testimony</i> to Luke's authorship is
decisive. The writer himself, in dedicating it to the same
Theophilus, expressly identifies himself with the author of the
third gospel: "The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of
all that Jesus began both to do and to teach." Acts 1:1. Then there
is a remarkable agreement in style and diction between the gospel
of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles, as any one may learn who
peruses them both together in the original Greek. Davidson,
Introduction to the New Testament, vol. 2, p. 8, has collected
forty-seven examples of "terms that occur in both, but nowhere else
in the New Testament." Luke, moreover, as the travelling companion
of Paul, had all needed facilities for composing such a work. With
regard to the latter portion of the book, this is denied by none.
His use of the first person plural, "we endeavored," "the Lord had
called us," "we came," etc.&mdash;which first appears, chap. 16:10,
and continues, with certain interruptions, through the remainder of
the book&mdash;admits of but one natural and reasonable
explanation, namely, that when he thus joins himself with the
apostle he was actually <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id=
"page90"></a>{90}</span> in his company. As it respects the first
part of the book, we notice that he visited C&aelig;sarea with
Paul's company, and "tarried there many days," chap. 21:8-10;
afterwards he went up with him to Jerusalem, chap. 21:15. We find
him again with Paul at C&aelig;sarea when he sets out for Rome.
Chap. 27:1. Now at such centres as Jerusalem and C&aelig;sarea he
must have had abundant opportunities to learn all the facts
recorded in the present book which could not be gathered from
Paul's own lips.</p>
<p>4. For the <i>credibility</i> of this book we have, in general,
the same arguments which apply to the gospel narratives, especially
to the gospel of Luke. Its author is evidently a sincere and
earnest man, who goes straight forward with his narrative; and
where he does not write as an eye-witness, he had, as we have seen,
abundant means of ascertaining the truth concerning the facts which
he records. His narrative is, moreover, corroborated in a very
special way, as will be shown hereafter&mdash;No. 8, below&mdash;by
its many undesigned coincidences with the events alluded to in the
epistle of Paul. To admit the credibility of the gospel of Luke and
to deny that of this work would be altogether inconsistent. In
truth, there is no ground for doubting the credibility of the Acts
of the Apostles other than that which lies in the assumption that
no record of miraculous events can be credible, and this is no
ground at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To some modern writers the narrative of the gift of tongues on
the day of Pentecost has seemed to present an insuperable
difficulty. Undoubtedly it is above our comprehension how a man
should suddenly become possessed of the ability to speak in a
language before unknown to him; but why should we doubt God's power
to bestow such a gift? Can any one suppose for a moment that when
our Saviour met with a person deaf and dumb from birth, he had, for
the first time, a case beyond his healing power? The gospel
narrative plainly indicates the contrary. Mark 7:32-37, upon which
passage see Meyer and Alford.</p>
<p>The account of the sudden death of Ananias and Sapphira, chap.
5:1-11, is not contrary to the spirit of the gospel. They died by
the immediate act of God. His wisdom judged such an example of
severity to be necessary in the beginning of the gospel, as a
solemn warning against hypocrisy and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span> falsehood in his service.
Though the gospel is a system of mercy, it takes, as all admit, a
severe attitude towards those who reject it; why not, then, towards
those who make a hypocritical profession of it? As Nadab and Abihu
were consumed by fire from heaven at the beginning of the Mosaic
economy, so the death of Ananias and his wife came early in the
dispensation of the Holy Ghost, as a testimony to all future ages
of Christ's abhorrence of hypocrisy, and consequently of the doom
which hypocrites will receive from him at the last day. Matt.
7:21-23.</p>
<p>The fact that Luke has omitted some events in the history of
Paul, as, for example, his journey into Arabia, which occurred
during the three years that intervened between his conversion and
his first visit to Jerusalem, Acts 9:22-26 compared with Gal.
1:15-18, is no argument against the credibility of his narrative.
Difficulties that arise simply from a writer's brevity must not be
allowed to set aside satisfactory evidence of his competency and
truthfulness. The historical difficulties connected with Stephen's
address do not concern Luke's credibility as a historian, and the
discussion of them belongs to the commentator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. The book of Acts closes with a notice that "Paul dwelt two
whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in
unto him, preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things
which concern the Lord Jesus, with all confidence, no man
forbidding him." As it adds no notice of the issue of his
imprisonment, or of what afterwards befell him, we naturally infer
that the book was written at Rome about this time, that is, about
A.D. 63.</p>
<p>II. <i>The Acknowledged Epistles</i>, 6. It is well known that
doubts existed, to a greater or less extent, in the primitive
churches before the fourth century, respecting the apostolic origin
and authority of certain books which now constitute a part of the
New Testament canon. Hence the distinction made by Eusebius between
the <i>acknowledged</i> books, (<i>homologoumena</i>) that is,
those that were universally received from the first, and the
<i>disputed</i> books, (<i>antilegomena</i>,) books respecting
which some entertained doubts. The <i>acknowledged</i> books are,
the four gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, the thirteen epistles
of Paul which bear his name at the beginning, the first epistle of
Peter, and the first epistle of John; twenty in all. The
<i>disputed</i> books <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id=
"page92"></a>{92}</span> are, the epistle to the Hebrews, the
epistle of James, the second epistle of Peter, the second and third
epistles of John, the epistle of Jude, and the book of Revelation;
seven in all. The gospels and the Acts have been already
considered, and the disputed books are reserved for the following
chapter. Some remarks will here be made on the fifteen acknowledged
epistles.</p>
<p>7. The epistles of Paul may be conveniently distributed into two
groups, of which the second or smaller contains the three pastoral
epistles, and the former or larger, the remaining ten. Of the
apostolic origin of the larger group little needs to be said. They
bear throughout the impress of genuineness and authenticity. No
doubts were ever entertained concerning them in the ancient
churches. There is, indeed, some ground for suspecting that a few
ancient copies of the epistle to the Ephesians omitted the words
<i>at Ephesus</i>&mdash;more literally <i>in
Ephesus</i>&mdash;chap. 1:1. But the genuineness of these words is
sustained by an overwhelming weight of evidence, and that Paul was
the author of the epistle was never once doubted by the ancient
churches. The arguments of some modern writers against its
apostolic origin have no real weight, as will be shown hereafter in
the introduction to the epistle.</p>
<p>Respecting the apostolic authorship of the three pastoral
epistles, two to Timothy and one to Titus, there was never any
doubt in the ancient churches. They are supported by the testimony
of the Peshito-Syriac version, of the Muratorian canon, also, (as
appears from Jerome's letter to Marcella and the quotations of the
church fathers before him,) of the Old Latin version; of
Iren&aelig;us, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and a multitude
of later writers. There are also some allusions to these epistles
in the apostolic fathers, which seem to be decisive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such are the following: "Let us therefore approach to him in
holiness of soul, <i>lifting up</i> to him <i>holy</i> and
unpolluted <i>hands</i>." Clement of Rome, First Epistle to the
Corinthians, chap. 29. "But the beginning of all mischief is the
love of money. Knowing, therefore, that <i>we brought nothing into
the world neither have power to carry any thing out</i>, let us arm
ourselves <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id=
"page93"></a>{93}</span> with the armor of righteousness."
Polycarp, Epistle to the Philippians, chap. 4. The student may see
other supposed allusions in Kirchhofer, Quellensammlung; Lardner,
2:39; Davidson's Introduction, 3, p. 101 seq.; Alford's New
Testament, Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respecting the <i>date</i> of the pastoral epistles very
different opinions are held. The whole discussion turns on the
question whether they were written <i>before</i> or <i>after</i>
Paul's imprisonment at Rome, which is recorded in the last chapter
of the Acts of the Apostles; and this again is connected with the
further question whether he underwent a second imprisonment at
Rome, concerning which learned men are not agreed. The full
discussion of this matter belongs to the introduction to the
pastoral epistles. It may be simply remarked, however, that the
internal arguments in favor of a late date are very strong, and
that its assumption accounts for the development of such a state of
things at Ephesus as appears in the two pastoral epistles to
Timothy&mdash;a state very different from that which existed when
the epistle to the Ephesians was written, between A.D. 60 and 64,
and which makes it necessary to separate the first epistle to
Timothy from that to the Ephesians by a considerable interval of
time.</p>
<p>The <i>theme</i> of the pastoral epistles is <i>peculiar</i>. It
is the affectionate counsel of an aged apostle to two young
preachers and rulers in the church respecting the duties of their
office. From the peculiarity of the subject-matter naturally
arises, to some extent, a peculiarity in the diction of these
epistles; yet the style and costume is throughout that of the
apostle Paul.</p>
<p>8. The testimony of the ancient church to the first epistle of
Peter and the first of John is very ample. Besides that of the
Peshito-Syriac version, and of the church fathers Iren&aelig;us,
Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria, they have in addition that
of Papias and the apostolic father Polycarp. The first epistle of
John is also included in the Muratorian canon. It scarcely needs,
however, any external testimony. The identity of its author with
that of the fourth gospel is so manifest from its whole tone and
style, that it has been always conceded that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> if one of
these writings came from the pen of the apostle John, the other did
also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The testimony of Papias to these two epistles, though indirect,
is conclusive. Eusebius says, Hist. Eccl. 3. 39, "The same Papias
has employed testimonies from the first epistle of John, and in
like manner of Peter." Polycarp says, Epistle to the Philippians,
ch. 7, "For every one who confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
in the flesh, is anti-Christ," with evident reference to 1 John
4:3. Eusebius says also, Hist. Eccl. 4. 14, that in the same
epistle to the Philippians Polycarp "has employed certain
testimonies from the first epistle of Peter;" and when we examine
the epistle we find several certain references to it, among which
are the following: "In whom, though ye see him not, ye believe; and
believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory."
Chap. 1 compared with 1 Pet. 1:8. "Believing in him who raised up
our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and gave him glory, and a seat
at his right hand." Chap. 2 compared with 1 Pet. 1:21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>9. The relation of the gospel history to the writings now under
consideration&mdash;the book of Acts and the apostolic
epistles&mdash;is of the most intimate and weighty character. The
truth of the earlier narratives contained in the gospels implies
the truth of these later works; for, as already remarked, they are
the natural sequel of the events there recorded. On the other hand,
the truth of these later writings implies the truth of the gospel
history; for in that history they find their full explanation, and
without it they are, and must ever remain, inexplicable. All the
parts of the New Testament constitute one inseparable whole, and
they all shed light upon each other. Like a chain of fortresses in
war, they mutually command each other. Unless the whole can be
overthrown, no one part can be successfully assailed. But to
overthrow the whole is beyond the power of man; for God has guarded
it on every side by impregnable bulwarks of evidence.</p>
<p>10. A special argument for the truth of the Scripture history of
the apostle Paul may be drawn from the numerous <i>undesigned
coincidences</i> between the events recorded in the book of Acts
and those referred to in the epistles. This work has been
accomplished with great ability and skill by Paley in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span>
Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;, to which the reader is referred. The
argument is very conclusive; for when we consider the
"particularity of St. Paul's epistles, the perpetual recurrence of
names of persons and places, the frequent allusions to the
incidents of his private life, and the circumstances of his
condition and history, and the connection and parallelism of these
with the same circumstances in the Acts of the Apostles, so as to
enable us, for the most part, to confront them one with another,"
we must be satisfied that the truth of the history can alone
explain such a multitude of coincidences, many of them of a minute
character, and all of them manifestly undesigned.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>{96}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE DISPUTED BOOKS.</h3>
<p>The grounds on which each of the disputed
books&mdash;Antilegomena, chap. 5, No. 6&mdash;is received into the
canon of the New Testament, will be considered in the introduction
to these books. In the present chapter some general suggestions
will be made which apply to them as a whole.</p>
<p>1. This is not a question concerning the <i>truth of
Christianity</i>, but concerning the <i>extent of the canon</i>; a
distinction which is of the highest importance. Some persons, when
they learn that doubts existed in the early churches, to a greater
or less extent, respecting certain books of the New Testament, are
troubled in mind, as if a shade of uncertainty were thereby cast
over the whole collection of books. But this is a very erroneous
view of the matter. The books of the New Testament, like those of
the Old, were written one after another, as occasion required; and
the churches received each of them separately on the evidence they
had of its apostolic origin and authority. At length collections of
these books, that is, <i>canons</i>, began to be formed. Such
collections translators would of necessity make, unless they found
them ready at hand. The earliest canons of which we have any
knowledge are contained in the old Latin version, the Syriac
version called Peshito, and the Muratorian canon; each of which
represented the prevailing judgment of the churches in the region
where it was formed. As this judgment differed in the different
provinces of Christendom in respect to the books in question, so
also do these canons. The Peshito contains the epistle to the
Hebrews and that of James, but omits the other five books. The
Muratorian canon omits the epistle to the Hebrews, the epistle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>{97}</span>
James, and the second epistle of Peter; but contains the epistle of
Jude, the book of Revelation, and apparently also the second and
third of John, though in respect to them its language is obscure
and of doubtful interpretation. The old Latin version, so far as we
can judge from the quotations of the church fathers, agreed in
general with the Muratorian canon. It contained, however, the
epistle of James, (Codex Corbeiensis, <i>ff</i>,) and that to the
Hebrews; and if, as has been supposed, this latter was a later
addition, it was yet earlier than the time of Tertullian. See
Westcott on the Canon, pp. 282, 283. Now this diversity of judgment
with regard to particular books does not affect in the least the
remaining books of the New Testament, which are sustained by the
authority of all the above-named witnesses, as well as by the
undivided testimony of the ancient churches. Did the New Testament
claim to be the work of <i>a single author</i>, the case would be
different. We should then have but <i>one</i> witness; and if
certain parts of his testimony could be successfully assailed, this
would throw a measure of suspicion on the whole. But now we have in
the separate books of the New Testament a <i>large number</i> of
witnesses, most of whom are entirely independent of each other.
Doubts respecting the testimony of one do not affect that of
another. We receive the seven books in question as a part of God's
revelation on grounds which we judge adequate, as will be shown in
the introductions to the several books. But if any one feels under
the necessity of suspending his judgment with respect to one or
more of these books, let him follow the teachings of the other
books, which are above all doubt. He will find in them all the
truth essential to the salvation of his soul; and he will then be
in a position calmly to investigate the evidence for the canonical
authority of the so-called disputed books.</p>
<p>2. The diversity of judgment which prevailed in the early
churches in respect to certain books of the New Testament, is in
harmony with all that we know of their character and spirit. It was
an age of free inquiry. General councils were not then known, nor
was there any central power to impose its decisions <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span> on all the
churches. In the essential doctrines of the gospel there was
everywhere an agreement, especially in receiving the writings
acknowledged to be apostolic, as the supreme rule of faith and
practice. But this did not exclude differences on minor points in
the different provinces of Christendom; and with respect to these
the churches of each particular region were tenacious then, as they
have been in all ages since, of their peculiar opinions and
practices. It is well known, for example, that the churches of Asia
Minor differed from those of Rome in the last half of the second
century respecting the day on which the Christian festival of the
Passover, with the communion service connected with it, should be
celebrated; the former placing it on the fourteenth of the month
Nisan, the latter on the anniversary of the resurrection Sunday.
Nor could the conference between Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna in Asia
Minor, and Anicetus, bishop of Rome, about A.D. 162, avail to
change the usage of either party, though it did not at that time
break the bond of brotherhood between them. We need not be
surprised therefore to find a like diversity in different regions
respecting certain books of the New Testament. The unanimous belief
of the Eastern and Alexandrine churches ascribed to Paul the
authorship of the epistle to the Hebrews; but in the Western
churches its Pauline authorship was not generally admitted till the
fourth century. The Apocalypse, on the contrary, found most favor
with the Western or Latin churches. It has in its favor the
testimony of the Muratorian canon, which is of Latin origin, and
also&mdash;as appears from the citations contained in the
commentaries of Primasius&mdash;that of the old Latin version.
Other examples see above, No. 1.</p>
<p>3. Although we cannot account for the universal and undisputed
reception of the acknowledged books by all the churches, except on
the assumption of their genuineness, the non-reception of a given
book by some of the early churches is no conclusive argument
against its apostolic origin. From the influence of circumstances
unknown to us, it may have remained for a considerable period of
time in comparative obscurity. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page99" id="page99"></a>{99}</span> We have good ground for
believing that some apostolic writings are utterly lost. To deny
the possibility of this would be to prejudge the wisdom of God. As
the apostles delivered many inspired discourses which it did not
please the Holy Ghost to have recorded, so they may have written
letters which he did not judge needful to make the sacred volume
complete. The question is one of fact, not of theory. The most
obvious interpretation of 1 Cor. 5:9 and Col. 4:16 is that Paul
refers in each case to an epistle which has not come down to us.
And if an inspired epistle might be lost, much more might the
knowledge and use of it be restricted for a time to a narrow circle
of churches. When such an epistle&mdash;for example, the second of
Peter&mdash;began to be more extensively known, the general
reception and use of it would be a slow process, not only from the
difficulty of communication in ancient as compared with modern
times, but also from the slowness with which the churches of one
region received any thing new from those of other regions.</p>
<p>Then again, if a book were known, there might be in some regions
hesitancy in respect to receiving it, from doubts in regard to its
author, as in the case of the epistle to the Hebrews and the
Apocalypse; or from the peculiarity of its contents also, as in the
case of the latter book. In the influence of causes like the above
named, we find a reasonable explanation of the fact that some
books, which the mature judgment of the churches received into the
canon of the New Testament, did not find at first a universal
reception.</p>
<p>4. In the caution and hesitation of the early churches with
respect to the books in question, we have satisfactory evidence
that, in settling the canon of the New Testament, they acted with
great deliberation and conscientiousness, their rule being that no
book should be received whose apostolic origin could not be
established on solid grounds. Did the early history of the
Christian church present no such phenomenon as that of the
distinction between acknowledged and disputed books, we might
naturally infer that all books that professed to have emanated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id=
"page100"></a>{100}</span> from the apostles, or to have had their
sanction, were received without discrimination. But now the mature
and final judgment of the churches is entitled to great
consideration. This judgment, let it be remembered, was not
affirmative only, but also <i>negative</i>. While it admitted to
the canon the seven books now under consideration, it excluded
others which were highly valued and publicly read in many of the
churches. On this ground it is entitled to still higher regard. It
is not, however, of binding authority, for it is not the decision
of inspired men. We have a right to go behind it, and to examine
the facts on which it is based, so far as they can be ascertained
from existing documents. But this work belongs to the introduction
to the several books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three books alone "obtained a partial ecclesiastical currency,
through which they were not clearly separated at first from the
disputed writings of the New Testament." Westcott on the Canon,
Appendix B, p. 550. This was on the ground that they were written,
or supposed to be written, by the immediate successors of the
apostles. The oldest known codex of the Bible is the
<i>Sinaitic</i>, discovered at mount Sinai by Tischendorf in 1859,
and which belongs to the fourth century. This contains the whole of
the epistle of Barnabas, and the first part of the work called the
Shepherd of Hermas. The Alexandrine codex, belonging to the fifth
century, has appended to it the first epistle of Clement of Rome to
the Corinthians, the genuineness of which is admitted, and also a
portion of the second or apocryphal epistle, the remainder of it
being lost. The explanation is, that these three books were read in
some at least of the churches when these codices were formed. But
they never obtained any permanent authority as canonical writings,
and were excluded from the New Testament "by every council of the
churches, catholic or schismatic." Tertullian, as quoted by
Westcott, p. 551.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>INSPIRATION AND THE CANON</h3>
<p>By the word <i>inspiration</i>, when used in a theological
sense, we understand such an illumination and guidance of the Holy
Spirit as raises a speaker or writer above error, and thus gives to
his teachings a divine authority. If we attempt to investigate the
interior nature of this superhuman influence, its different degrees
and modes of operation, and the relation which the human mind holds
to the divine in the case of those who receive it, we find
ourselves involved in many difficulties, some of which at least are
to our finite minds insuperable. But if we look at it from a
practical point of view, restricting our inquiries to the
<i>end</i> proposed by God in inspiration, which is to furnish his
church with an infallible and sufficient rule of faith and
practice, we find no difficulty in understanding the subject so far
as our duty and welfare are concerned. From such a practical
position the question of inspiration will now be discussed; and the
inquiry will be, at present, restricted to the writings of the New
Testament. In connection with this discussion will also be
considered the subject of the <i>canon</i>, not in its particular
extent, but in the <i>principle</i> upon which it is formed.</p>
<p>1. It is necessary, first of all, to find a sure <i>rule</i> by
which we can try the claims of a given book to be inspired, and
consequently to be admitted into the canon of the New Testament. It
cannot be simply the writer's own declaration. It will be shown
hereafter that, in connection with other evidence, his testimony
concerning himself is of the highest importance. But the point now
is, that no man's inspiration is to be acknowledged simply on his
own word. Nor can we decide simply <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page102" id="page102"></a>{102}</span> from the contents of the
book. Very important indeed is the question concerning the contents
of any book which claims to be a revelation from God. Yet we cannot
take the naked ground that a given book is inspired because its
contents are of a given character. This would be virtually to set
up our own reason as the supreme arbiter of divine truth, which is
the very position of rationalism. Nor can we receive a book as
inspired on the so-called authority of the church, whether this
mean the authority of a man who claims to be its infallible head,
or the authority of a general council of the churches. Admitting
for a moment the Romish doctrine of the infallibility of the
church, we could know this infallibility not from the declaration
of any man or body of men in the church, but from Scripture alone.
But this is assuming at the outset the infallibility of Scripture,
and therefore its inspiration, which is the very point at issue.
Looking at the question on all sides, we shall find for a given
book of the New Testament no valid test of the writer's inspiration
except <i>his relation to the Lord Jesus Christ</i>. This
presupposes our Lord's divine mission and character, and his
supreme authority in the church. It is necessary therefore to begin
with the great central fact of the gospel, that Jesus of Nazareth
is the Son of God, and that through him God has made to men a
revelation of his own character and will for their salvation. This
fact is to be first established according to the ordinary rules of
human evidence, as has been attempted in the preceding chapters.
After that we come naturally to the inspiration of the record, and
can establish it also on a sure foundation.</p>
<p>2. The great fundamental truth that Jesus is the Son of God, who
dwelt from eternity with the Father, knew all his counsels, and was
sent by him to this fallen world on a mission of love and mercy,
being established on an immovable foundation, we have a sure point
of departure from which to proceed in our inquiries respecting
inspiration. It becomes at once a self-evident
proposition&mdash;the great axiom of Christianity, we may call
it&mdash;that the teaching of Jesus Christ, when he was on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id=
"page103"></a>{103}</span> earth, was truth unmixed with error.
This he himself asserted in the most explicit terms: "The Father
loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth."
John 5:20. "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall
not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." John 8:12.
"He that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things
which I have heard of him." John 8:26. "I have not spoken of
myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment,
what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his
commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even
as the Father said unto me, so I speak." John 12:49, 50. Proceeding
then from the position of our Lord's infallibility, let us inquire
whether any of his disciples, and if so, who among them, were
divinely qualified to teach, and consequently to record, without
error, the facts and doctrines of his gospel. There are but two
grades of relationship to Christ with which we can connect such a
high endowment: that of <i>apostles</i>, and that of their
<i>companions</i> and fellow-laborers. Let us consider each of
these in order.</p>
<p>3. Early in our Lord's ministry he chose <i>twelve apostles</i>,
"that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to
preach, and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out
devils." Mark 3:14, 15. In this brief notice we have all the
distinguishing marks of an apostle. He was chosen that he might be
with Christ from the beginning, and thus be to the people an
eye-witness of his whole public life. When an apostle was to be
chosen in the place of Judas, Peter laid particular stress on this
qualification: "Wherefore of these men which have companied with us
all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was
taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of
his resurrection." Acts 1:21, 22. In the case of Paul alone was
this condition of apostleship wanting; and this want was made up to
him by the special revelation of Jesus Christ. Gal. 1:11, 12. An
apostle, again, was one who received his commission to preach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id=
"page104"></a>{104}</span> immediately from the Saviour, a
qualification which Paul strenuously asserted in his own behalf:
"Paul an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ,
and God the Father, who raised him from the dead." Gal. 1:1. An
apostle, once more, was one who received directly from Christ the
power of working miracles. This was the <i>seal</i> of his
apostleship before the world. In the three particulars that have
been named the apostles held to Christ the nearest possible
relation, and were by this relation distinguished from all other
men. Have we evidence that they were divinely qualified, through
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to preach and record the facts
and doctrines of the gospel without error?</p>
<p>That they must have been thus qualified, we have, in the
<i>first</i> place, a strong presumption from <i>the necessity of
the case</i>. Though our Lord finished the work which the Father
gave him to do on earth, he did not finish the revelation of his
gospel. On the contrary, he said to his disciples just before his
crucifixion, "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he
will guide you into all truth." John 16:12, 13. Let us look at some
of these things which were reserved for future revelation. The
purely spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom was not understood by
the apostles till after the day of Pentecost, for we find them
asking, just before his ascension, "Lord, wilt thou at this time
restore the kingdom to Israel?" a question which he did not answer,
but referred them to the promised gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts
1:6-8. Another of the things which they could not bear was the
abolition, through Christ's propitiatory sacrifice, of the Mosaic
law, and with it, of the middle wall of partition between Jews and
Gentiles. This great truth was reserved to be revealed practically
in the progress of the gospel, as recorded in the book of Acts, and
doctrinally in the epistles of Paul. Then what a rich unfolding we
have in the apostolic epistles of the meaning of our Lord's death
on Calvary, and in connection with this, of the doctrine of
justification by faith&mdash;faith not simply in Christ, but in
<i>Christ crucified</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
id="page105"></a>{105}</span> Faith in Christ's person the
disciples had before his death; but faith in him as crucified for
the sins of the world they could not have till after his
resurrection and exaltation to the right hand of God. The
abovenamed truths&mdash;not to specify others, as, for example,
what Paul says of the resurrection, 1 Cor., ch. 15; 1. Thess.
4:13-18&mdash;enter into the very substance of the gospel. They
are, in fact, integral parts of it. Can we suppose that our Lord
began the revelation of his gospel by his own infallible wisdom,
and then left it to be completed by the fallible wisdom of men? If
Augustine and Jerome in the latter period of the Roman empire, if
Anselm and Bernard in the middle ages, if Luther and Calvin at the
era of the Reformation, if Wesley and Edwards in later days, commit
errors, the mischief is comparatively small; for, upon the
supposition that the apostles were qualified by the Holy Ghost to
teach and write without error, we have in their writings an
infallible standard by which to try the doctrines of later
uninspired men. But if the apostles whom Christ himself appointed
to finish the revelation which he had begun, and whom he endowed
with miraculous powers, as the seal of their commission, had been
left without a sure guarantee against error, then there would be no
standard of truth to which the church in later ages could appeal.
No man who believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and that he came
into the world to make to men a perfect revelation of the way of
life, can admit such an absurd supposition.</p>
<p>In the <i>second</i> place, we have <i>Christ's express
promises</i> to his apostles that they should be divinely qualified
for their work through the gift of the Holy Ghost: "But when they
deliver you up, take no thought"&mdash;be not solicitous, as the
original signifies&mdash;"how or what ye shall speak, for it shall
be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not
ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in
you." Matt. 10:19, 20. "But when they shall lead you, and deliver
you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do
ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>{106}</span> in that
hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy
Ghost." Mark 13:11. "And when they bring you unto the synagogues,
and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what
thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: for the Holy Ghost
shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say." Luke 12:11,
12. "Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what
ye shall answer: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all
your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist." Luke
21:14, 15. The above promises are perfectly explicit; and although
they refer primarily to a particular emergency, in which the
apostles would especially feel their need of divine guidance, they
cover, in their spirit, all other emergencies. We cannot read them
without the conviction that they contain the promise to the
apostles of all needed help and guidance in the work committed to
them. If they were divinely qualified to defend the gospel before
their adversaries without error&mdash;"I will give you a mouth and
wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor
resist"&mdash;so were they also to <i>record the facts</i> of the
gospel, and to unfold in their epistles its doctrines.</p>
<p>The promises recorded in the gospel of John are more general and
comprehensive in their character. It will be sufficient to adduce
two of them: "These things have I spoken unto you being yet present
with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and
bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
you." John 14:25, 26. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but
ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is
come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of
himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he
will show you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall
receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the
Father hath are mine: therefore said I that he shall take of mine,
and shall show it unto you." John 16:12-15. In the former of these
passages the special promise is that the Holy <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span> Spirit
shall bring to the remembrance of the apostles and unfold to their
understanding all Christ's personal teachings; so that they shall
thus have a fuller apprehension of their meaning than they could
while he was yet with them. The second promise is introduced with
the declaration that the Saviour has yet many things to say to his
apostles which they cannot now bear. Of course these things are
reserved for the ministration of the Spirit, as he immediately
proceeds to show: "When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will
guide you into all truth." The Spirit shall glorify Christ; for he
shall take of the things which are Christ's, and reveal them to the
apostles. And what are the things which are Christ's? "All that the
Father hath;" for the Father has given all things into the hands of
the Son. John 13:3. Among these "all things" are included all the
Father's counsels pertaining to the way of salvation through the
Son. These are given to the Son; and the Holy Ghost shall take of
them and reveal to the church, through the apostles, as much as it
is needful for the church to know. In these remarkable words we
have at once a proof of our Lord's deity, and a sure guarantee to
the apostles of supernatural illumination and guidance in the work
committed to them&mdash;all the illumination and guidance which
they needed, that they might be qualified to finish without error
the revelation of the gospel which Christ had begun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question is often asked: Were these promises given to the
apostles alone, or through them to the church at large? The answer
is at hand. They were given <i>primarily</i> and in a <i>special
sense</i> to the apostles; for they had reference to a special work
committed to them, which required for its performance special
divine illumination and guidance. They were also given, in an
important sense, to the church at large; since all believers enjoy,
through the teaching of the apostles, the benefit of these
revelations of the Holy Spirit. They are not, however, made to all
believers personally; but were given, once for all, through the
apostles to the church. The gift of the Holy Spirit is indeed made
to all believers personally: through his enlightening and
sanctifying power they have all needed help and guidance. But they
are not called, as were the apostles, to lay the foundations of the
Christian faith, and have therefore no promise of new <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>{108}</span>
revelations from the Spirit or of elevation above all error, any
more than they have of miraculous gifts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now prepared to consider, in the <i>third</i> place, the
<i>claims</i> which the apostles themselves made to speak and write
with divine authority. Although their simple word as men could
avail nothing, yet this same word, taken in connection with their
known relation to Christ, with the work committed to them, and with
the promises made to them, is of the most weighty import. It was
not indeed their custom to assert gratuitously their superhuman
guidance and authority. Yet when occasions arose, from the nature
of the subject under discussion, or from the opposition of false
teachers, they did so in unambiguous terms. Thus the apostle Paul,
writing to the Corinthians, says, "Now we have received not the
spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might
know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things
also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but
which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual," 1 Cor. 2:12, 13: and writing to the Thessalonians
concerning the resurrection, "For this we say unto you by the word
of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of
the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep," etc. 1 Thess.
4:15. And again, in writing to the Galatians, among whom his
apostolic standing had been called in question by certain Judaizing
teachers, he says, "I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which
was preached of me is not after man: for I neither received it of
man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus
Christ." Gal. 1:11, 12. This language is explicit enough. It could
have been used only by one who was conscious of having been
divinely qualified to teach the gospel without error. Accordingly,
in the same epistle, he opposes his apostolic authority to these
false teachers: "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be
circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing." Gal. 5:2. In the
memorable letter of the apostles and elders to the Gentile
churches, Acts 15:23-29, they say, "It seemed good to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id=
"page109"></a>{109}</span> Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no
greater burden than these necessary things." "To the Holy Ghost and
to us" can mean only, to us under the guidance of the Holy Ghost.
Besides such explicit assertions as the above, there is a tone of
authority running through the apostolic writings which can be
explained only from their claim to speak with divine authority.
They assert the weightiest truths and make the weightiest
revelations concerning the future, as men who know that they have a
right to be implicitly believed and obeyed. What majesty of
authority, for example, shines through Paul's discussion of the
doctrine of the resurrection, 1 Cor., ch. 15, where he announces
truths that lie wholly beyond the ken of human reason. "Behold,"
says he, "I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed," as one who has perfect assurance that he
speaks from God. The same tone of certainty runs through all the
remarks which the apostle John interweaves into his gospel, as well
as through his epistles, and through the other apostolic
writings.</p>
<p>To sum up in a single sentence what has been said respecting the
apostles: When we consider the strong presumption, arising from the
necessity of the case, that they must have been divinely qualified
to teach and write without error, the explicit promises of Christ
that they should be thus qualified, and their explicit claims under
these promises, we have full evidence that they wrote, as well as
spoke, under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and consequently
that their writings are of divine authority.</p>
<p>4. In the second grade of relationship to Christ stand men who,
like Mark and Luke, were not themselves apostles, but were the
<i>companions of apostles</i>, and their associates in the work of
preaching the gospel. We are not authorized to place them in the
same rank with the apostles. Yet they had the gift of the Holy
Spirit, which was always given in connection with ordination at the
hands of the apostles. If, in addition to this, their connection
with some of the apostles was of such an intimate nature that we
cannot suppose them to have written <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span> without their knowledge and
approbation, we have for their writings all the apostolic authority
that is needed. The intimate relation of Luke to the apostle Paul
has been already sufficiently shown. We have good ground for
believing that he was with him when he wrote both the gospel and
the book of Acts. The intimate connection of Mark with the apostle
Peter is shown by the unanimous testimony of the primitive
churches, and is confirmed, moreover, by an examination of the
peculiarities of his gospel. In entire harmony with the position of
these two evangelists is the character of their writings. They
never assume the office of independent teachers, but restrict
themselves to a careful record of the works and words of Christ and
his apostles.</p>
<p>5. A final argument for the inspiration of the books of the New
Testament, whether written by apostles or their companions, may be
drawn from their general character, as contrasted with that of the
writings which remain to us from the age next succeeding that of
the apostles. The more one studies the two classes of writings in
connection, the deeper will be his conviction of the distance by
which they are separated from each other. The descent from the
majesty and power of the apostolic writings to the best of those
which belong to the following age is sudden and very great. Only by
a slow process did Christian literature afterwards rise to a higher
position through the leavening influence of the gospel upon
Christian society, and especially upon Christian education. The
contrast now under consideration is particularly important in our
judgment of those books which, like the second epistle of Peter,
are sustained by a less amount of external evidence. Though we
cannot decide on the inspiration of a book simply from the
character of its contents, we may be helped in our judgment by
comparing these, on the one hand, with writings acknowledged to be
apostolic, and on the other, with writings which we know to be of
the following age.</p>
<p>6. The inspiration of the sacred writers was <i>plenary</i> in
the sense that they received from the Holy Spirit all the
illumination <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id=
"page111"></a>{111}</span> and guidance which they needed to
preserve them from error in the work committed to them. With regard
to the degree and mode of this influence in the case of different
books, it is not necessary to raise any abstract questions. That
Paul might make to the Galatians a statement of his visits to
Jerusalem and the discussions connected with them, Galatians,
chaps. 1, 2, or might give an account of his conversion before king
Agrippa, Acts, ch. 26, it was not necessary that he should receive
the same kind and measure of divine help as when he unfolded to the
Corinthians the doctrine of the resurrection, 1 Cor., ch. 15. And
so in regard to the other inspired penmen. Whatever assistance each
of them needed, he received. If his judgment needed divine
illumination for the selection of his materials, it was given him.
If he needed to be raised above narrowness and prejudice, or to
have the Saviour's instructions unfolded to his understanding, or
to receive new revelations concerning the way of salvation or the
future history of Christ's kingdom&mdash;whatever divine aid was
necessary in all these cases, was granted. Thus the books of the
New Testament, being written under the guidance of the Holy Ghost,
become to the Christian church an infallible rule of faith and
practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there be any limitation connected with the inspiration of the
sacred writers, it is one of which the Holy Spirit is himself the
author, and which cannot therefore injuriously affect their
testimony. It did not please God, for example, that the exact order
of time should always be kept in the gospel narratives; nor that
the identical forms of expression employed by the Saviour on given
occasions should always be preserved; nor that the accompanying
circumstances should in all cases be fully stated; for in all these
respects the evangelists frequently differ among themselves. Had
the wisdom of God judged it best, minute accuracy in these
particulars might have been secured. But the result would probably
have been injurious, by leading men to exalt the letter above the
spirit of the gospel. We should be glad to know with certainty
which, if any, of the different ways that have been proposed for
reconciling John's narrative with those of the other evangelists in
respect to the day of the month on which our Lord ate his last
passover with his disciples, is the true one. It would give us
pleasure were we able to arrange all the incidents connected with
our Lord's resurrection, as recorded by the four evangelists, in
the exact order of their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
id="page112"></a>{112}</span> occurrence. Had we a full record of
all the circumstances pertaining to these two transactions, this
might be accomplished. But it would not make any essential addition
to our knowledge of the gospel. We should have, in every jot and
tittle, the same way of salvation that we have now, and the same
duties in respect to it. To all who, on grounds like these, find
difficulty with the doctrine of plenary inspiration, we may say, in
the words of the apostle, "Brethren, be not children in
understanding; howbeit, in malice be ye children, but in
understanding be men."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. The <i>extent of the canon</i> is determined by the <i>extent
of inspiration</i>. The question to be settled respecting each book
of the New Testament is, Was it written under the guidance of the
Holy Spirit? or, which amounts to the same thing, Has it apostolic
authority? If it has, it is to be received; if not, it is to be
rejected. There is no middle ground&mdash;no division of the canon
into books of primary and of secondary authority.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id=

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>INSEPARABLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW
TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>Although the great central truth of redemption, that "the Father
sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world," and that we have in
the New Testament a true record of this mission, rests, as has been
shown, upon an immovable foundation, we have as yet seen the
argument in only half its strength. Not until we consider the
advent of Christ in connection with the bright train of revelations
that preceded and prepared the way for his coming, do we see it in
its full glory, or comprehend the amount of divine testimony by
which it is certified to us. We have already seen, chap. 5. 1, how
the events recorded in the Acts of the Apostles follow, as a
natural sequel, from the truth of the gospel history; how, if we
admit the former, we ought, for very consistency, to admit the
latter also, since the two cling together as inseparable parts of
one great plan. It is now proposed to look backward from the
Saviour's advent to the preceding series of revelations, and show
how naturally in the plan of God they preceded that great event,
and how inseparably they were connected with it as parts of one
great whole.</p>
<p>1. The supernatural mission of Christ furnishes, in and of
itself, a very strong presumption in favor of <i>previous</i>
supernatural revelations. That such a mighty event as this should
have burst upon the world abruptly, without any previous
preparation, is contrary to the whole order of providence as well
as of nature, which is, "first the blade, then the ear, after that
the full corn in the ear." And since the advent of Christ was
miraculous in the fullest sense of the term, why should not the way
for it have been prepared by miraculous revelations as <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>{114}</span> well as
by providential movements? The natural sun does not emerge suddenly
from the darkness of night: his approach is preceded by the
day-star and the dawn. So were the revelations which God made to
men from Adam to Malachi, with the mighty movements of his
providence that accompanied them, the day-star and the dawn that
ushered in upon the world the glorious sun of righteousness.</p>
<p>2. We have the great fact that the Jewish people, among whom our
Lord appeared, and from among whom he chose the primitive preachers
of the gospel, possessed a firm and deeply-rooted belief in the
unity of God and his infinite perfections. That such a belief was a
necessary foundation for the peculiar doctrines of Christianity,
all of which are underlaid by that of trinity in unity, is
self-evident. Now, this belief was peculiar to the Jews, as
contrasted with other nations; and it was held, moreover, not
simply by a few philosophers and learned men among them, but by the
mass of the people. No other example of a whole nation receiving
and holding firmly this fundamental doctrine of religion existed
then, or had ever existed; and no adequate explanation of this
great fact has ever been given, except that contained in the
revelation of God to this people recorded in the Old Testament. It
was not by chance, but in accordance with the eternal plan of
redemption, that the Messiah appeared where as well as when he did;
not in Egypt in the days of Pharaoh, nor in Nineveh, or Babylon, or
Greece, or Rome; but among the Jewish people, when now "the fulness
of time was come."</p>
<p>3. The impossibility of any attempt to dissever the revelations
of the Old Testament from those of the New appears most clearly
when we consider the <i>explicit declarations</i> of our Saviour,
and after him the apostles, on this point. If we know any thing
whatever concerning the doctrines of our Lord Jesus, we know that
he constantly taught his disciples that he had come in accordance
with the prophecies of the Old Testament. If there were found in
his discourses only one or two remote allusions to these
prophecies, there would be more show of reason in the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>{115}</span> favorite
hypothesis of rationalists, that the disciples misapprehended their
Lord's meaning. But his teachings are so numerous and explicit on
this point that, even aside from the inspiration of the writers,
such an explanation is not to be thought of for a moment. It was
with two of them a matter of personal knowledge that "beginning at
Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
Scriptures the things concerning himself," Luke 24:27; and with all
of them that he said, after his resurrection, in reference to his
past teachings: "These are the words which I spake unto you, while
I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were
written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms
concerning me." Luke 24:44. That in Christ were fulfilled the
prophecies of the Old Testament, appears in every variety of form
in the gospel narratives. It constituted, so to speak, the warp
into which the Saviour wove his web of daily instruction. Now if a
single thread, unlike all the rest in substance and color, had
found its way into this warp, we might, perhaps, regard it as
foreign and accidental; but to dissever from our Lord's words all
his references to the prophecies concerning himself in the Old
Testament, would be to take out of the web all the threads of the
warp, and then the web itself would be gone. No unbiased reader
ever did, or ever could gain from the words of Christ and his
apostles any other idea than that Jesus of Nazareth came in
accordance with a bright train of supernatural revelations going
before and preparing the way for his advent. This idea is so
incorporated into the very substance of the New Testament that it
must stand or fall with it.</p>
<p>4. Having contemplated the indivisible nature of revelation from
the position of the New Testament, we are now prepared to go back
and look at it from the platform of the Old Testament. We shall
find this thickly sown with those great principles which underlie
the plan of redemption, and bind it together as one glorious
whole.</p>
<p><i>First</i> of all, we have in the narrative of Adam's fall and
the consequences thence proceeding to the race, the substratum, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id=
"page116"></a>{116}</span> to speak, on which the plan of
redemption is built. From this we learn that alienation from God
and wickedness is not the original condition of the race. Man was
made upright and placed in communion with God. From that condition
he fell, in the manner recorded in the Old Testament; and to
restore him, through Christ, to his primitive state is the work
which the gospel proposes to accomplish. The great historic event
of redemption is that "the Son of God was manifested that he might
destroy the works of the devil;" and these are the very works
described in the narrative now under consideration, namely, the
seduction of man from his allegiance to God, with the misery and
death that followed. The primitive history of man's apostacy
contains, then, the very key to the plan of redemption. So it is
plainly regarded by the apostle Paul. He builds upon it arguments
relating not to the outworks of redemption, but to its inward
nature. He makes the universality of man's fallen condition through
the sin of Adam the platform on which is built the universality of
the provisions of salvation through Christ. "As by the offence of
one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the
righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
justification. For as by one man's disobedience many were made
sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
Rom. 5:18, 19. "Since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
shall all be made alive." 1 Cor. 15:21, 22. How could the original
transaction of the fall, through the wiles of the devil, and the
manifestation of God's Son to destroy the works of the devil, be
more indissolubly bound together as parts of one great whole than
in these words of an inspired apostle?</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, the Abrahamic covenant connects itself
immediately with the mission and work of Christ. It was made with
Abraham, not for himself and his posterity alone, but for all
mankind: "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed." Gen. 22:18. And if the Abrahamic covenant had respect to
the whole human family, the same must be true of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>{117}</span> the
Mosaic economy in its <i>ultimate</i> design; since this did not
abrogate the covenant made with Abraham, as the apostle Paul
expressly shows, Gal. 3:17, but rather came in as subordinate to
it, and with a view of preparing the way for the accomplishment of
its rich provisions of mercy for "all families of the earth." The
Mosaic economy was then a partial subservient to a universal
dispensation.</p>
<p>The Abrahamic covenant was also purely spiritual in its
character, the condition of its blessings being nothing else than
faith. The apostle Paul urges the fact that this covenant was made
with Abraham before his circumcision, lest any should say that it
was conditioned wholly or in part upon a carnal ordinance: "He
received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of
the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised." Rom. 4:11. The
seal of circumcision, then, did not make the covenant valid, for
the covenant existed many years before the rite of circumcision was
instituted. Faith was the only condition of Abraham's
justification. "He believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him
for righteousness." Gen. 15:6.</p>
<p>And if we look at the promise contained in the Abrahamic
covenant, "In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed,"
we find it to be the very substance of the gospel, as the apostle
Paul says: "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed." Gal. 3:8. The
incarnation and work of Christ are, according to the uniform
representation of the New Testament, nothing else but the carrying
out of the covenant made with Abraham, for this covenant was made
for all mankind, was purely spiritual, being conditioned on faith
alone, and its substance is Christ, in whom all nations are
blessed.</p>
<p>And while God has thus indissolubly linked to the incarnation of
his Son this high transaction with Abraham, we see how he has at
the same time connected it with the first promise made in Eden, and
thus with the fall of man through the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span> subtilty
of Satan. The promise in Eden is that the seed of the woman shall
bruise the serpent's head. The promise to Abraham is that in his
seed, which is also the seed of the woman, all the families of the
earth shall be blessed. Now it is by the bruising of the serpent's
head, or, in New Testament language, by destroying the works of the
devil, that Abraham's seed blesses all the families of the earth.
The two promises, then, are in their inmost nature one and the
same, and their fulfilment constitutes the work of Christ.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, the end of the Mosaic economy is Christ. Its
general scope is thus briefly summed up by Paul: "The law was our
schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by
faith." Gal. 3:25. But not to insist on this, let us contemplate
its three great institutions&mdash;the prophetic, the kingly, and
the priestly order.</p>
<p>The mode of communication which God employed on Sinai the people
could not endure, and they besought him, through Moses, that it
might be discontinued: "Speak them with us," they said, "and we
will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die." Ex. 20:19.
Of this request God approved, and promised: "I will raise them up a
Prophet from among their brethren like unto thee." Deut. 18:18. The
point of special emphasis is, that the great Prophet here promised,
who is Christ, should be <i>one of their brethren</i>, as Moses
was. His personal advent was for many ages delayed; but in the
meantime his office was foreshadowed by the prophetical order in
Israel, consisting of men sent by God to address their brethren.
Thus the old dispensation and the new are linked together by the
great fundamental principle&mdash;that God should address man
through man&mdash;which runs through both. The whole series of Old
Testament prophecies, moreover, point to Christ as their end and
fulfilment; "for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
Rev. 19:10.</p>
<p>The kingly office of the Old Testament connects itself with that
of Christ in a special way. Not only did the headship given to
David and his successors over the covenant people of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>{119}</span> God
adumbrate the higher headship of Christ, but David had from God the
promise: "Thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever." 2 Sam.
7:16. This promise is fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth, "the seed of
David according to the flesh," according to the express declaration
of the New Testament: "The Lord God shall give unto him the throne
of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for
ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Luke 1:32, 33.</p>
<p>The priestly office, with the blood of the sacrifices connected
with it, prefigured Christ, "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world." By the stream of sacrificial blood that flowed
for so many ages was set forth that great fundamental truth of
redemption, that "without shedding of blood is no remission." Heb.
9:22. The sacrifices of the Mosaic law were continually repeated,
because "it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
should take away sins." Heb. 10:4. But when Christ had offered his
own blood on Calvary for the sins of the world, the typical
sacrifices of the law ceased for ever, having been fulfilled in the
great Antitype, "in whom we have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins." Ephes. 1:7.</p>
<p>5. Since the Old Testament and the New are thus inseparably
connected as parts of one grand system of revelation, of which the
end is Christ, it follows that the later revelations of the New
Testament are the true interpreters of the earlier, which are
contained in the Old. This is only saying that the Holy Ghost is
the true and proper expositor of his own communications to man.
From the interpretations of Christ and his apostles, fairly
ascertained, there is no appeal. And they are fairly ascertained
when we have learned in what sense they must have been understood
by their hearers. All expositions of the Old Testament that set
aside, either openly or in a covert way, the supreme authority of
Christ and his apostles, are false, and only lead men away from the
truth as it is in Jesus.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id=

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>AUTHORSHIP OF THE PENTATEUCH.</h3>
<p>The term <i>Pentateuch</i> is composed of the two Greek words,
<i>pente</i>, <i>five</i>, and <i>teuchos</i>, which in later
Alexandrine usage signified <i>book</i>. It denotes, therefore, the
collection of five books; or, the five books of the law considered
as a whole.</p>
<p>1. In our inquiries respecting the authorship of the Pentateuch,
we begin with the undisputed fact that it existed in its present
form in the days of Christ and his apostles, and had so existed
from the time of Ezra. When the translators of the Greek version,
called the Septuagint, began their work, about 280 B.C., they found
the Pentateuch as we now have it, and no one pretends that it had
undergone any change between their day and that of Ezra, about 460
B.C. It was universally ascribed to Moses as its author, and was
called in common usage <i>the law</i>, or the <i>law of
Moses</i>.</p>
<p>2. That the authorship of the law in its written form is
ascribed to Moses in the New Testament every one knows. "The law
was given by Moses;" "Did not Moses give you the law?" "Had ye
believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me;"
"For the hardness of your heart he," Moses, "wrote you this
precept;" "Master, Moses wrote unto us;" "What is written in the
law? how readest thou?" etc. Since now the whole collection of
books was familiarly known to the people as <i>the law</i>, or
<i>the law of Moses</i>, it is reasonable to infer that our Saviour
and his apostles use these terms in the same comprehensive sense,
unless there is a limitation given in the context. Such a
limitation the apostle Paul makes when he opposes to the Mosaic law
the previous promise to Abraham: "The covenant that was confirmed
before of God in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id=
"page121"></a>{121}</span> Christ, the law, which was four hundred
and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the
promise of none effect." Gal. 3:17, and compare the following
verses. But in the following chapter Paul manifestly employs the
words <i>the law</i> of the whole Pentateuch, to every part of
which he, in common with the Jewish people, ascribed equal and
divine authority: "Tell me, ye that desire to be under
<i>law</i>"&mdash;under a system of law, the article being wanting
in the original&mdash;"do ye not hear <i>the law</i>? For it is
written, that Abraham had two sons; the one by a bond-maid, the
other by a free woman," etc., Gal. 4:21, seq., where the reference
is to the narrative recorded in Genesis, as a part of the law. So
also in the following passage: "Moses of old time hath in every
city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every
sabbath-day," Acts 15:21; the term Moses necessarily means the law
of Moses, as comprehending the whole Pentateuch, for it was that
which was read in the synagogues. Compare the words of Luke: "After
the reading of the law and the prophets," Acts 13:15. And in
general, when Christ and his apostles speak of Moses or the law,
without any limitation arising from the context, thus, "The law was
given by Moses;" "They have Moses and the prophets," etc., we are
to understand them as referring to the Pentateuch as a whole, for
such was the common usage of the Jewish people, and such must have
been their apprehension of the meaning of the terms.</p>
<p>3. But it may be said, Christ and his apostles did not speak as
critics, but only in a popular way. That they did not speak of the
Pentateuch as critics, is certain. They had no occasion for doing
so, since no Jew doubted either its divine authority or its Mosaic
authorship. But when we consider, on the one side, with what
unsparing severity our Lord set aside the traditions of the
Pharisees as "the commandments of men," and on the other, how he
and his apostles ascribed equal divine authority to every part of
the Pentateuch, as will be shown in the next chapter, and how
unequivocally they sanctioned the universal belief that Moses was
its author, we must acknowledge that we <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>{122}</span> have the
entire authority of the New Testament for its Mosaic authorship in
every essential respect. This is entirely consistent with the
belief that inspired men, like Ezra, and perhaps also prophetical
men of an earlier age, in setting forth revised copies of the
Pentateuch, that is, copies which aimed to give the true text with
as much accuracy as possible, may have added here and there
explanatory clauses for the benefit of the readers of their day.
Such incidental clauses, added by men of God under the guidance of
his Spirit, would not affect in the least the substance of the
Pentateuch. It would still remain in every practical sense the work
of Moses, and be so regarded in the New Testament.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether there are, or are not, in the Pentateuch, such clauses
added by a later hand, and not affecting either its essential
contents or its Mosaic authorship, is an open question to be
determined by impartial criticism. At the present day editors
carefully indicate their explanatory notes; but this was not the
usage of high antiquity. At the close of the book of Deuteronomy,
for example, there is immediately added, without any explanatory
remark, a notice of Moses' death. We are at liberty to assume, if
we have cogent reasons for so doing, that brief explanatory clauses
were sometimes interwoven into the Mosaic text; as, for example,
the remark in Gen. 36:31, which is repeated in 1 Chron. 1:43, a
book ascribed to Ezra; Exod. 16:35, 36, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. Going back now to the days of the <i>Restoration</i> under
Zerubbabel and his associates, about 536 B.C., we find that the
very first act of the restored captives was to set up "the altar of
the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is
written in the law of Moses the man of God." The narrative goes on
to specify that "they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto the
Lord, even burnt-offerings morning and evening. They kept also the
feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily
burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of
every day required; and afterwards offered the continual
burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of
the Lord that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly
offered a free-will offering unto the Lord." Ezra 3:1-5. About
ninety years afterwards, upon <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page123" id="page123"></a>{123}</span> the completion of the walls
of Jerusalem under Nehemiah, about 445 B.C., we find Ezra the
priest&mdash;"a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord
God of Israel had given," Ezra 7:6&mdash;on the occasion of the
feast of tabernacles bringing forth "the book of the law of Moses,
which the Lord had commanded to Israel," and reading in it "from
the morning unto midday, before the men and the women, and those
that could understand." In this work he was assisted by a body of
men, who "caused the people to understand the law;" and the reading
was continued through the seven days of the feast: "day by day,
from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the
law of God." Neh. ch. 8. It was not the book of Deuteronomy alone
that they read. We might infer this from the extent of the reading,
which was sufficient for all the preceptive parts of the
Pentateuch. But here we are not left to mere inference. On the
second day "they found written in the law which the Lord had
commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in
booths in the feast of the seventh month;" and that they should
"fetch olive-branches, and pine-branches, and myrtle-branches, and
palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it
is written." Neh. 8:13-17. The precept concerning booths with
boughs of trees occurs in Lev. 23:40-43, a passage which they might
naturally enough reach on the second day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ezra's assistants gave the sense not by labored expositions, but
by interpreting the Hebrew in the Chaldee vernacular of the people.
This would about double the time devoted to a given section. All
that pertained to the structure of the tabernacle was superseded by
the first temple, which served the returned captives as their model
in the erection of the second. We may well suppose that this was
omitted. There would then remain only four or five chapters in the
book of Exodus. Thus the passage in question would naturally fall
on the second day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Jewish tradition ascribes to Ezra the work of settling the
canon of the Old Testament, and setting forth a corrected edition
of the same. Though some things included in this tradition are
fabulous, the part of it now under consideration is <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>{124}</span>
corroborated by all the scriptural statements concerning him, nor
is there any reasonable ground for doubting its correctness. Be
this as it may, it is admitted that from Ezra's day onward the
Pentateuch existed in its present form. We are sure, therefore,
that "the book of the law of Moses," out of which he read to the
people, was the book as we now have it&mdash;the whole Pentateuch,
written, according to uniform Jewish usage, on a single roll. Ezra
belonged to the priestly order that had in charge the keeping of
the sacred books, Deut. 31:25, 26, compared with 2 Kings 22:8, and
was moreover "a ready scribe in the law of Moses." His zeal for the
re&euml;stablishment of the Mosaic law in its purity shines forth
in his whole history. In his competency and fidelity we have
satisfactory evidence that the law of Moses which he set forth was
the very law which had been handed down from ancient times, and of
which we have frequent notices in the books of Kings and
Chronicles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is generally supposed that Ezra himself wrote the books of
Chronicles. They were certainly composed about his time. To admit,
as all do, that in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah the law of Moses
means the Pentateuch as a whole, and to deny that it has the same
meaning in the books of Chronicles, is very inconsistent. Certainly
the book which Ezra set forth was the book which he found ready at
hand, and therefore the book referred to in the Chronicles, and the
Kings also. Any explanatory additions which he may have made did
not affect its substance. It remains for the objector to show why
it was not, in all essential respects, the book which Hilkiah found
in the temple, 2 Chron. 34:14, and to which David referred in his
dying charge to Solomon, 1 Kings 2:3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. Passing by, for the present, the notices of the law of Moses
contained in the book of Joshua, we come to the testimony of the
book of Deuteronomy. We have seen that the Mosaic authorship of the
book, as a part of the Pentateuch, is everywhere assumed by the
writers of the New Testament. But, in addition to this, they make
quotations from it under the forms, "Moses wrote," "Moses truly
said unto the fathers," etc. Mark 10:3-5; Acts 3:22; Rom. 10:19. If
we examine the book itself, its own testimony is equally explicit.
In chap. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
"page125"></a>{125}</span> 17:24 Moses directs that when the
Israelites shall appoint a king, "he shall write him a copy of this
law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites."
In the opinion of some, this language refers to the whole law of
Moses, while others would restrict it to the book of Deuteronomy;
but all are agreed that it includes the whole of the latter work,
with the exception of the closing sections. By a comparison of this
passage with chaps. 28:58; 31:9, 24-26, the evidence is complete
that Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests, to be
laid up by the side of the ark in the tabernacle. If this testimony
needed any corroboration, we should have it in the character of the
work itself. It is the solemn farewell of the aged lawgiver to the
people whose leader he had been for the space of forty years. In
perfect harmony with this are the grandeur and dignity of its
style, its hortatory character, and the exquisite tenderness and
pathos that pervade every part of it. It is every way worthy of
Moses; nor can we conceive of any other Hebrew who was in a
position to write such a book.</p>
<p>7. The book of Deuteronomy contains a renewal of the covenant
which God made with the children of Israel at Sinai. Chap.
29:10-15. Moses himself distinguishes between the former and the
latter covenant. "These are the words of the covenant which the
Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the
land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in
Horeb." Chap. 29:1. With each covenant was connected a series of
laws; those belonging to the latter being mainly, but not entirely,
a repetition of laws given with the first covenant. We have seen
that Moses wrote the second covenant, and all the laws connected
with it. From Exodus, ch. 24, we learn that he wrote also the book
of the first covenant containing, we may reasonably suppose, all of
God's legislation up to that time. The inference is irresistible
that he wrote also the laws that followed in connection with the
first covenant. It is an undeniable fact that these laws underlie
the whole constitution of the Israelitish nation, religious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
"page126"></a>{126}</span> civil, and social. They cannot, then,
have been the invention of a later age; for no such fraud can be
imposed, or was ever imposed upon a whole people. They are their
own witness also that they were given by the hand of Moses, for
they are all prefaced by the words, "And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying." When we consider their fundamental character, their
extent, and the number and minuteness of their details, we cannot
for a moment suppose that they were left unwritten by such a man as
Moses, who had all the qualifications for writing them. Why should
not the man who received them from the Lord have also recorded
them&mdash;this man educated at the court of Egypt, and learned in
all the wisdom of the Egyptians, who had already written "the book
of the covenant," and afterwards wrote the journeyings of the
Israelites, Numb. ch. 23, and the book of Deuteronomy? An express
statement from Moses himself is not needed. The fact is to be
understood from the nature of the case, and to call it in question
is gratuitous skepticism.</p>
<p>8. The form of the Mosaic laws that precede the book of
Deuteronomy is in perfect harmony with the assumption that Moses
himself not only received them, but wrote them. They bear the
impress of having been recorded not continuously, but from time to
time, as they were communicated to him. In this way the historical
notices which are woven into them&mdash;the matter of the golden
calf, Exodus, ch. 32, the death of Nadab and Abihu, Leviticus, ch.
10, the blasphemy of Shelomith's son, Leviticus, ch. 24, and the
numerous incidents recorded in the book of Numbers&mdash;all these
narratives find a perfectly natural explanation. Some of these
incidents&mdash;as, for example, the blasphemy of Shelomith's
son&mdash;come in abruptly, without any connection in the context;
and their position can be accounted for only upon the assumption
that they were recorded as they happened. In this peculiar feature
of the Mosaic code before Deuteronomy, we have at once a proof that
Moses was the writer, and that the historical notices connected
with it were also recorded by him. The result at which we arrive is
that the whole record from God's appearance to Moses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id=
"page127"></a>{127}</span> his mission to Pharaoh has Moses himself
for its author. The authorship of the preceding part of the
Pentateuch will be considered separately.</p>
<p>9. The above result in reference to that part of the law which
precedes Deuteronomy, is confirmed by the <i>testimony of the New
Testament</i>. In disputing with the Sadducees, our Lord appealed
to the writings of Moses, which they acknowledged: "Now that the
dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the
Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob." Luke 20:37. It was by recording the words of God, as given
in Exodus 3:6, that Moses called the Lord the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. The apostle Paul, again, referring to Lev. 18:5,
says: "Moses describeth"&mdash;literally, <i>writeth</i>&mdash;"the
righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those
things shall live by them." Rom. 10:5. Here also belong certain
passages that speak of precepts in "the law of Moses," as Luke
2:22-24, where the reference is to various precepts in Exodus,
Leviticus, and Numbers&mdash;Exod. 13:2; 22:29; 34:19; Lev. 12:2,
seq.; Numb. 3:13; 8:17; 18:15&mdash;John 7:22, 23, where the
reference is to Lev. 12:2; for with the New Testament writers "the
law of Moses" means the law written by Moses. In like manner we
find references in the Old Testament to the books of the law of
Moses that precede Deuteronomy&mdash;2 Chron. 23:18 compared with
Numb. 28:2, seq.; 2 Chron. 24:6 compared with Exod. 30:12, seq.;
Ezra 3:2-5 compared with Numb. 28:2, seq., and 29:12, seq.; Neh.
8:15 compared with Lev. 23:40.</p>
<p>10. The relation of the book of Deuteronomy to the earlier
portions of the law deserves a careful consideration. And, first,
in regard to <i>time</i>. All that portion of the law which
precedes the sixteenth chapter of the book of Numbers was given in
the first and second years after the exodus; consequently
thirty-eight years before the composition of the book of
Deuteronomy. The four chapters of Numbers that follow, chaps.
16-19, are generally dated about twenty years later&mdash;that is,
about eighteen years before the composition of Deuteronomy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id=
"page128"></a>{128}</span> Only the last seventeen chapters of
Numbers, which are mostly occupied with historical notices, were
written in the preceding year.</p>
<p>Then, as it respects general <i>design</i>. At Horeb the entire
constitution of the theocracy was to be established. This part of
the law is, therefore, more formal and circumstantial. It gives
minute directions for the celebration of the passover; for the
construction of the tabernacle and its furniture; for the dress,
consecration, duties, and perquisites of the priesthood and
Levitical order; for the entire system of sacrifices; for the
distinction between clean and unclean animals; for all those duties
that were especially of a priestly character, as judgment in the
case of leprosy, and purification from ceremonial uncleanness; for
the order of journeying and encamping in the wilderness, etc. In a
word, it gives more prominence to the forms of the law, and the
duties of those to whom its administration was committed. Not so on
the plains of Moab. The theocracy had then been long in operation.
The details of its service were well understood, and there was no
need of formal and circumstantial repetition. The work of Moses now
was not to give a new law, but to enforce the law of Horeb, with
such subordinate modifications and additions as were required by
the new circumstances of the people, now about to take possession
of the promised land and change their wandering life for fixed
abodes. He had to do, therefore, more prominently not with the
administrators of law, but with the people; and accordingly his
precepts assume a hortatory character, and his style becomes more
diffuse and flowing.</p>
<p>The <i>personal relation</i> of Moses to the people was also
greatly changed. At Horeb he had the great work of his life before
him, but now it is behind him. He is about to leave his beloved
Israel, whom he has borne on his heart and guided by his counsels
for forty years. Hence the inimitable tenderness and pathos that
pervade the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>When now we take into account all these altered circumstances,
we have a full explanation of the peculiarities which <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>{129}</span> mark the
book of Deuteronomy as compared with the preceding books. Were
these peculiarities wanting, we should miss a main proof of its
genuineness. Nevertheless the book is thoroughly Mosaic in its
style, and the scholar who reads it in the original Hebrew can
detect peculiar forms of expression belonging only to the
Pentateuch. As to alleged disagreements between some of its
statements and those of the earlier books, it is sufficient to
remark that upon a candid examination they mostly disappear; and
even where we cannot fully explain them, this furnishes no valid
ground for denying the genuineness of either portion of the law.
Such seeming discrepancies are not uncommon when a writer of
acknowledged credibility repeats what he has before written.
Compare, for example, the three narratives of the apostle Paul's
conversion which are recorded in the book of Acts.</p>
<p>The question as to the extent of meaning which should be given
in Deuteronomy to the expressions, "a copy of this law," "the words
of this law," "this book of the law," is one upon which expositors
are not agreed, nor is it essential; since, as we have seen, the
Mosaic authorship of the former part of the law rests upon broader
grounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Deut. 27:3, 8, it seems necessary to understand the
expression, "all the words of this law," which were to be written
upon tables of stone set up on mount Ebal, of the blessings and
curses&mdash;ver. 12, 13&mdash;contained in this and the following
chapter. But elsewhere, chs. 17:18; 31:9, 24-26, we must certainly
include at least the whole of Deuteronomy. If we suppose that it
was Moses' custom to write out the precepts of the law with the
historical notices pertaining to them in a continuous roll, which
was enlarged from time to time, and that he added to this roll the
book of Deuteronomy, then the words in question must be understood
of the entire body of precepts from the beginning. But if, as seems
to be intimated in Deut. 31:24, he wrote Deuteronomy in a separate
book, ("<i>in a book</i>," without the article,) the words
naturally refer to Deuteronomy alone. This work, as containing a
summary of the law&mdash;<i>a second law</i>, as the word
<i>Deuteronomy</i> signifies&mdash;might well be spoken of as "this
law," without any denial of an earlier law; just as the covenant
made with the people at this time is called "this covenant," ch.
29:14, without any denial of an earlier covenant. The reverent
scholar will be careful not to be wise above what <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>{130}</span> is
written. It might gratify our curiosity to know exactly in what
outward form Moses left the Law with the historical notices woven
into it; whether in one continuous roll, or in several rolls which
were afterwards arranged by some prophet, perhaps with connecting
and explanatory clauses; but it could add nothing to our knowledge
of the way of salvation. In either case it would be alike the law
of Moses and the law which Moses wrote, invested with full divine
authority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>11. It being established that Moses wrote the whole law with the
historical notices appertaining to it, we naturally infer that he
must have written the book of Genesis also, which is introductory
to the law. For this work he had every qualification, and we know
of no other man that had the like qualifications. On this ground
alone the Mosaic authorship of the book might be reasonably
assumed, unless decided proofs to the contrary could be adduced.
But we find, upon examination, that the book of Genesis is so
<i>connected with the following books</i> that without the
knowledge of its contents they cannot be rightly understood. The
very first appearance of God to Moses is introduced by the remark
that he "remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with
Jacob." In addressing Moses he calls the children of Israel "my
people," Exod. 3:6-10; and sends Moses to Pharaoh with the message,
"Let my people go." All this implies a knowledge of the covenant
which God made with Abraham and his seed after him, by virtue of
which the Israelites became his peculiar people. It is not simply
as an oppressed people that God undertakes to deliver them and give
them possession of the land of Canaan, but as <i>his</i> people.
Again and again does Moses describe the promised land as "the land
which the Lord sware unto your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
to give unto them and to their seed after them." With the book of
Genesis these declarations are plain; but without it they are
unintelligible. The Abrahamic covenant, which is recorded in the
book of Genesis, is not a subordinate, but an essential part of the
history of the Israelites. It underlies the whole plan of
redemption, and upon it the Mosaic economy, as a part of that plan,
is erected. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id=
"page131"></a>{131}</span> Why should any one suppose that Moses,
who recorded the establishment of this economy with all its
details, omitted to record the great transactions with the
patriarchs which lie at its foundation? There are other references
to the book of Genesis in the law of Moses. The institution of the
Sabbath is expressly based on the order of creation recorded in the
first two chapters; and when the people leave Egypt they carry with
them the bones of Joseph, in accordance with the oath which he had
exacted of them. Gen. 50:25, compared with Exod. 13:19.</p>
<p>To the Mosaic authorship of Genesis it has been objected, that
it contains marks of a <i>later age</i>. But these marks, so far as
they have any real existence, belong not to the substance of the
book. They are restricted to a few explanatory notices, which may
well have been added by Ezra or some prophetical man before him, in
setting forth a revised copy of the law. See No. 3, above. The
passages which can, with any show of probability, be referred to a
later age, are, taken all together, very inconsiderable, and they
refer only to incidental matters, while the book, as a whole, bears
all the marks of high antiquity.</p>
<p>To the Mosaic authorship of this book it has been objected
again, that it contains the writings of <i>different authors</i>.
This is especially argued from the diversity of usage in respect to
the divine name, some passages employing the word <i>Elohim</i>,
<i>God</i>, others the word <i>Jehovah</i>, or a combination of the
two terms. Whatever force there may be in this argument, the
validity of which is denied by many who think that the inspired
writer designedly varied his usage between the general term
<i>God</i> and the special covenant name <i>Jehovah</i>, it goes
only to show that Moses may have made use of previously existing
documents; a supposition which we need not hesitate to admit,
provided we have cogent reasons for so doing. Whatever may have
been the origin of these documents, they received through Moses the
seal of God's authority, and thus became a part of his inspired
word.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id=
"page132"></a>{132}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>Several writers have attempted to distinguish throughout the
book of Genesis the parts which they would assign to different
authors; but beyond the first chapters they are not able to agree
among themselves. All attempts to carry the distinction of
different authors into the later books rest on fanciful
grounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>12. That the Pentateuch, as a whole, proceeded from a single
author, is shown by the unity of plan that pervades the whole work.
The book of Genesis constitutes, as has been shown, a general
introduction to the account which follows of the establishment of
the theocracy; and it is indispensable to the true understanding of
it. In the first part of the book of Exodus we have a special
introduction to the giving of the law; for it records the
deliverance of the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, and their
journey to Sinai. The Mosaic institutions presuppose a sanctuary as
their visible material centre. The last part of Exodus, after the
promulgation of the ten commandments and the precepts connected
with them, is accordingly occupied with the construction of the
tabernacle and its furniture, and the dress and consecration of the
priests who ministered there. In Leviticus, the central book of the
Pentateuch, we have the central institution of the Mosaic economy,
namely, the system of sacrifices belonging to the priesthood, and
also, in general, the body of ordinances intrusted to their
administration. The theocracy having been founded at Sinai, it was
necessary that arrangements should be made for the orderly march of
the people to the land of Canaan. With these the book of Numbers
opens, and then proceeds to narrate the various incidents that
befell the people in the wilderness, with a record of their
encampments, and also the addition from time to time of new
ordinances. The book of Deuteronomy contains the grand farewell
address of Moses to the Israelites, into which is woven a summary
of the precepts already given which concerned particularly the
people at large, with various modifications and additions suited to
their new circumstances and the new duties about to be devolved
upon them. We see then that the Pentateuch constitutes a consistent
whole. Unity of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id=
"page133"></a>{133}</span> design, harmony of parts, continual
progress from beginning to end&mdash;these are its grand
characteristics; and they prove that it is not a heterogeneous
collection of writings put together without order, but the work of
a single master-spirit, writing under God's immediate direction,
according to the uniform testimony of the New Testament.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>AUTHENTICITY AND CREDIBILITY OF THE PENTATEUCH.</h3>
<p>1. The historic truth of the Pentateuch is everywhere assumed by
the writers of the New Testament in the most absolute and
unqualified manner. They do not simply allude to it and make
quotations from it, as one might do in the case of Homer's poems,
but they build upon the facts which it records arguments of the
weightiest character, and pertaining to the essential doctrines and
duties of religion. This is alike true of the Mosaic <i>laws</i>
and of the <i>narratives</i> that precede them or are interwoven
with them. In truth, the writers of the New Testament know no
distinction, as it respects divine authority, between one part of
the Pentateuch and another. They receive the whole as an authentic
and inspired record of God's dealings with men. A few examples,
taken mostly from the book of Genesis, will set this in a clear
light.</p>
<p>In reasoning with the Pharisees on the question of divorce, our
Lord appeals to the primitive record: "Have ye not read that he
which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and
said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? wherefore
they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath
joined together, let not man put asunder." And when, upon this, the
Pharisees ask, "Why did Moses then command to give a writing of
divorcement, and to put her away?" Deut. 24:1, he answers in such a
way as to recognize both the authority of the Mosaic legislation
and the validity of the ante-Mosaic record: "Moses, because of the
hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives: but
from the beginning it was not so." He then proceeds to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>{135}</span> enforce
the marriage covenant as it was "from the beginning." Matt. 19:3-9,
compared with Gen. 2:23, 24. In like manner the apostle Paul
establishes the headship of the man over the woman: "He is the
image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. For
the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. Neither was
the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man." 1 Cor.
11:7-9, compared with Gen. 2:18-22. And again: "I suffer not a
woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in
silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not
deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression." 1
Tim. 2:12-14, compared with Gen. 2:18-22; 3:l-6, 13. So also he
argues from the primitive record that, as by one man sin and death
came upon the whole human race, so by Christ Jesus life and
immortality are procured for all. Rom. 5:12-21; 1 Cor. 15:21, 22,
compared with Gen. 2:17; 3:19, 22. The story of Cain and Abel, Gen.
4:3-12, is repeatedly referred to by the Saviour and his apostles
as a historic truth: Matt. 23:35; Luke 11:51; Heb. 11:4; 12:24; 1
John 3:12; Jude 11. So also the narrative of the deluge: Gen. chs.
6-8, compared with Matt. 14:37-39; Luke 17:26, 27; Heb. 11:7; 1
Peter 3:20; 2 Peter 2:5; and of the overthrow of Sodom and
Gomorrah, Gen. ch. 19, compared with Luke 17:28, 29; 2 Peter 2:6;
Jude 7. It is useless to adduce further quotations. No man can read
the New Testament without the profound conviction that the
authenticity and credibility of the Pentateuch are attested in
every conceivable way by the Saviour and his apostles. To reject
the authority of the former is to deny that of the latter also.</p>
<p>2. For the authenticity and credibility of the Pentateuch we
have an independent argument in the fact that it lay at the
foundation of the whole Jewish polity, civil, religious, and
social. From the time of Moses and onward, the Israelitish nation
unanimously acknowledged its divine authority, even when, through
the force of sinful passion, they disobeyed its commands. The whole
life of the people was moulded and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page136" id="page136"></a>{136}</span> shaped by its institutions;
so that they became, in a good sense, a peculiar people, with "laws
diverse from all people." They alone, of all the nations of the
earth, held the doctrine of God's unity and personality, in
opposition to all forms of polytheism and pantheism; and thus they
alone were prepared to receive and propagate the peculiar doctrines
of Christianity. Chap. 8, No. 2. If now we admit the truth of the
Mosaic record, all this becomes perfectly plain and intelligible;
but if we deny it, we involve ourselves at once in the grossest
absurdities. How could the Jewish people have been induced to
accept with undoubting faith such a body of laws as that contained
in the Pentateuch&mdash;so burdensome in their multiplicity, so
opposed to all the beliefs and practices of the surrounding
nations, and imposing such severe restraints upon their corrupt
passions&mdash;except upon the clearest evidence of their divine
authority? Such evidence they had in the stupendous miracles
connected with their deliverance from Egypt and the giving of the
law on Sinai. The fact that Moses constantly appeals to these
miracles, as well known to the whole body of the people, is
irrefragable proof of their reality. None but a madman would thus
appeal to miracles which had no existence; and if he did, his
appeal would be met only by derision. Mohammed needed not the help
of miracles, for his appeal was to the sword and to the corrupt
passions of the human heart; and he never attempted to rest his
pretended divine mission on the evidence of miracles. He knew that
to do so would be to overthrow at once his authority as the prophet
of God. But the Mosaic economy needed and received the seal of
miracles, to which Moses continually appeals as to undeniable
realities. But if the miracles recorded in the Pentateuch are real,
then it contains a revelation from God, and is entitled to our
unwavering faith. Then too we can explain how, in the providence of
God, the Mosaic institutions prepared the way for the advent of
"Him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write." Thus we
connect the old dispensation with the new, and see both together as
one whole.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id=
"page137"></a>{137}</span>
<p>Other arguments might be adduced; but upon these two great
pillars&mdash;the authority, on the one side, of the New Testament,
and, on the other, the fact that the Pentateuch contains the entire
body of laws by which the Jewish nation was moulded and formed, and
that its character and history can be explained only upon the
assumption of its truth&mdash;on these two great pillars the
authenticity and credibility of the Pentateuch rest, as upon an
immovable basis.</p>
<p>3. The <i>difficulties</i> connected with the Pentateuch, so far
as its contents are concerned, rest mainly on two grounds,
<i>scientific</i> and <i>historical</i>, or <i>moral</i>. The
nature of the scientific difficulties forbids their discussion
within the restricted limits of the present work. It may be said,
however, generally, that so far as they are real, they relate not
so much to the truth of the Mosaic record, as to the manner in
which certain parts of it should be understood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long, for example, that state of things continued which is
described in Gen. 1:2, or what particular results were produced by
the operation of the divine Spirit there recorded, we do not know.
What extent of meaning should be assigned to the six days of
creation&mdash;whether they should be understood literally or in a
symbolical way, like the prophetical days of Daniel and
Revelation&mdash;Dan. 7:25; 9:24-27; Rev. 9:15; 11:3, etc.&mdash;is
a question on which devout believers have differed ever since the
days of Augustine. See Prof. Tayler Lewis' Six Days of Creation,
ch. 14. But all who receive the Bible as containing a revelation
from God agree in holding the truth of the narrative. So also in
regard to the Deluge and other events involving scientific
questions which are recorded in the book of Genesis. Some of these
questions may perhaps be satisfactorily solved by further inquiry.
Others will probably remain shrouded in mystery till the
consummation of all things. To the class of historical difficulties
belong several chronological questions, as, for example, that of
the duration of the Israelitish residence in Egypt. It is
sufficient to say that however these shall be settled&mdash;if
settled at all&mdash;they cannot with any reasonable man affect the
divine authority of the Pentateuch which is certified to us by so
many sure proofs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. The difficulties which are urged against the Pentateuch on
moral grounds rest partly on misapprehension, and are partly of
such a character that, when rightly considered, they <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> turn
against the objectors themselves. This will be illustrated by a few
examples.</p>
<p>A common objection to the Mosaic economy is drawn from its
<i>exclusiveness</i>. It contains, it is alleged, a religion not
for all mankind, but for a single nation. The answer is at hand.
That this economy may be rightly understood, it must be considered
not separately and independently, but as one part of a great plan.
It was, as we have seen, subordinate to the covenant made with
Abraham, which had respect to "all the families of the earth."
Chap. 8, No. 4. It came in temporarily to prepare the way for the
advent of Christ, through whom the Abrahamic covenant was to be
carried into effect. It was a <i>partial</i>, preparatory to a
<i>universal</i> dispensation, and looked, therefore, ultimately to
the salvation of the entire race. So far then as the benevolent
design of God is concerned, the objection drawn from the
exclusiveness of the Mosaic economy falls to the ground. It remains
for the objector to show how a universal dispensation, like
Christianity, could have been wisely introduced, without a previous
work of preparation, or how any better plan of preparation could
have been adopted than that contained in the Mosaic economy.</p>
<p>If the laws of Moses interposed, as they certainly did, many
obstacles to the intercourse of the Israelites with other nations,
the design was not to encourage in them a spirit of national pride
and contempt of other nations, but to preserve them from the
contagious influence of the heathen practices by which they were
surrounded. On this ground the Mosaic laws everywhere rest the
restrictions which they impose upon the Israelites: "Thy daughter
thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
to thy son. For they will turn away thy son from following me, that
they may serve other gods." Deut. 7:3, 4. How necessary were these
restrictions was made manifest by the whole subsequent history of
the people. So far was the Mosaic law from countenancing hatred
towards the <i>persons</i> of foreigners, that it expressly
enjoined kindness: "If a stranger sojourn with thee in your land,
ye shall not vex him. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id=
"page139"></a>{139}</span> But the stranger that dwelleth with you
shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as
thyself: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." Lev.
19:34.</p>
<p>5. Another ground of objection to the Mosaic law has been the
number and minuteness of its ordinances. That this feature of the
theocracy was, absolutely considered, an imperfection, is boldly
asserted in the New Testament. The apostle Peter calls it "a yoke
which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear." Acts 15:10.
Nevertheless the wisdom of God judged it necessary in the infancy
of the nation, that it might thus be trained, and through it the
world, for the future inheritance of the gospel. It is in this very
aspect that the apostle Paul says: "The law was our schoolmaster to
bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But
after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
Gal. 3:24, 25. The divine plan was to prescribe minutely all the
institutions of the Mosaic economy, leaving nothing to human
discretion, apparently to prevent the intermixture with them of
heathenish rites and usages; perhaps also that in this body of
outward forms the faith of the Israelites might have a needful
resting-place, until the way should be prepared for the
introduction of a simpler and more spiritual system.</p>
<p>We must be careful, however, that we do not fall into the error
of supposing that the Mosaic law prescribed a religion of mere
outward forms. On the contrary, it was pervaded throughout by an
evangelical principle. It knew nothing of heartless forms in which
the religion of the heart is wanting. The observance of all its
numerous ordinances it enjoined on the spiritual ground of love,
gratitude, and humility. If any one would understand in what a
variety of forms these inward graces of the soul, which constitute
the essence of religion, are inculcated in the Pentateuch, he has
but to read the book of Deuteronomy; there he will see how the law
of Moses aimed to make men religious not in the letter, but in the
spirit; how, in a word, it rested the observance of the letter on
the good foundation of inward devotion to God. The summary which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id=
"page140"></a>{140}</span> our Saviour gave of the Mosaic law, and
in it of all religion, he expressed in the very words of the law:
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength," Deut.
6:4, 5; "this is the first and great commandment. And the second is
like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Lev.
19:18. Nor is this love towards our neighbor restricted to a narrow
circle; for it is said of the stranger also sojourning in Israel,
"Thou shalt love him as thyself." Lev. 19:34.</p>
<p>6. Of one usage which the Mosaic law tolerated, our Saviour
himself gives the true explanation when he says: "Moses, because of
the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives;
but from the beginning it was not so." Matt. 19:8. This general
principle applies also to polygamy and the modified form of
servitude which prevailed among the Hebrew people. That the Mosaic
economy suffered, for the time being, certain usages not good in
themselves, is no valid objection to it, but rather a proof of the
divine wisdom of its author. Though it was his purpose to root out
of human society every organic evil, he would not attempt it by
premature legislation, any more than he would send his Son into the
world until the way was prepared for his advent.</p>
<p>7. The extirpation of the Canaanitish nations by the sword of
the Israelites was contemplated by the Mosaic economy. The names of
these nations were carefully specified, and they were peremptorily
forbidden to molest other nations; as, for example, the Edomites,
Moabites, and Ammonites. Deut. 2:4, 5, 8, 9, 18, 19. The whole
transaction is to be regarded as a sovereign act of Jehovah, which
had in view the manifestation of his infinite perfections for the
advancement of the cause of truth and righteousness in this fallen
world. Though we may not presume to fathom all the divine counsels,
we can yet see how God, by the manner in which he gave Israel
possession of the promised land, displayed his awful holiness, his
almighty power, and his absolute supremacy over the nations of the
earth, not only to the covenant people, but also to the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id=
"page141"></a>{141}</span> heathen world. Had the Canaanites
perished by famine, pestilence, earthquake, or fire from heaven, it
might have remained doubtful to the heathen by whose anger their
destruction had been effected, that of the Canaanitish gods, or of
the God of Israel. But now that God went forth with his people,
dividing the Jordan before them, overthrowing the walls of Jericho,
arresting the sun and the moon in their course, and raining down
upon their enemies great hailstones from heaven, it was manifest to
all that the God of Israel was the supreme Lord of heaven and
earth, and that the gods of the gentile nations were vanity. This
was one of the great lessons which the Theocracy was destined to
teach the human family. At the same time the Israelites, who
executed God's vengeance on the Canaanites, were carefully
instructed that it was for their sins that the land spewed out its
inhabitants, and that if they imitated them in their abominations,
they should in like manner perish.</p>
<p>8. The Mosaic economy was but the scaffolding of the gospel. God
took it down ages ago by the hand of the Romans. It perished amid
fire and sword and blood, but not till it had accomplished the
great work for which it was established. It bequeathed to
Christianity, and through Christianity to "all the families of the
earth," a glorious body of truth, which makes an inseparable part
of the plan of redemption, and has thus blessed the world ever
since, and shall continue to bless it to the end of time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>REMAINING BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>1. The divine authority of the Pentateuch having been
established, it is not necessary to dwell at length on the
historical books which follow. The events which they record are a
natural and necessary sequel to the establishment of the theocracy,
as given in the five books of Moses. The Pentateuch is occupied
mainly with the founding of the theocracy; the following historical
books describe the settlement of the Israelitish nation under this
theocracy in the promised land, and its practical operation there
for the space of a thousand years. There is no history in the world
so full of God's presence and providence. It sets forth with divine
clearness and power, on the one side, God's faithfulness in the
fulfilment of the promises and threatenings contained in the Mosaic
law; and on the other, the perverseness and rebellion of the
people, and their perpetual relapses into idolatry, with the mighty
conflict thus inaugurated between the pure monotheism of the
theocracy, and the polytheism and image-worship of the surrounding
heathen nations&mdash;a conflict which lasted through many ages,
which enlisted on both sides the great and mighty men of the world,
and which resulted in the complete triumph of the Mosaic law, at
least so far as its outward form was concerned, thus preparing the
way for the advent of that great Prophet in whom the theocracy had
its end and its fulfilment.</p>
<p>2. How fully the divine authority of these books is recognized
by Christ and his apostles, every reader of the New Testament
understands. It is not necessary to establish this point by the
quotation of particular passages. Though the writers of the
<i>historical</i> books which follow the Pentateuch are for the
most part unknown, the books themselves are put in the New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id=
"page143"></a>{143}</span> Testament on the same basis as the
Pentateuch. To those who deny Christ, the Mosaic economy, with the
history that follows, is a mystery; for when they read it "the veil
is upon their heart." But to those who receive Christ as the Son of
God, and the New Testament as containing a true record of his
heavenly mission, Moses and the historical books that follow are
luminous with divine wisdom and glory, for they contain the record
of the way in which God prepared the world for the manifestation of
his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>3. The Old Testament contains a body of writings which are not
historical; neither are they prophetical, in the restricted sense
of the term, although some of them contain prophecy. The
enumeration of these books, prominent among which are Job, Psalms,
and Proverbs, with an account of their contents and the place which
each of them holds in the plan of revelation, belongs to the
Introduction to the Old Testament. It is sufficient to say here,
that they are precious offshoots of the Mosaic economy, that they
contain rich and varied treasures of divine truth for the
instruction and encouragement of God's people in all ages, and that
they are, as a whole, recognized in the New Testament as part of
God's revelation to men. The book of Psalms, in particular, is
perpetually quoted by the writers of the New Testament as
containing prophecies which had their fulfilment in Jesus of
Nazareth.</p>
<p>4. The prophetical books&mdash;according to our classification,
the Jews having a different arrangement&mdash;are Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, Daniel, and the twelve minor prophets. The vast body of
prophecies contained in these books&mdash;the prophetical portions
of the other books being also included&mdash;may be contemplated in
different points of view.</p>
<p>Many of these prophecies, considered independently of the New
Testament, afford conclusive proof that the Old Testament is the
word of God, for they bear on their front the signet of their
divine origin. They contain predictions of the distant future which
lie altogether beyond the range of human sagacity and foresight.
Such is the wonderful prophecy of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page144" id="page144"></a>{144}</span> Moses respecting the
history of the Israelitish people through all coming ages, Lev. ch.
26; Deut. ch. 28, a prophecy which defies the assaults of
skepticism, and which, taken in connection with our Lord's solemn
declaration, "They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall
be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be
trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
fulfilled," Luke 21:24, marks both the Old Testament and the New as
given by the same omniscient God, who declares the end from the
beginning. Such also are the predictions of the utter and perpetual
desolation of Babylon, uttered ages beforehand, and which
presuppose a divine foresight of the course of human affairs to the
end of time: "Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in
from generation to generation." "I will also make it a possession
for the bittern and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the
besom of destruction, saith the Lord of hosts." Isa. 13:19, 20;
14:23. See also the prophecy of the overthrow of Nineveh, Nahum,
chs. 2, 3, and of Tyre: "I will also scrape her dust from her, and
make her like the top of a rock. It shall be a place for the
spreading of nets in the midst of the sea." "I will make thee like
the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou
shalt be built no more." Ezek. 26:4, 5, 14. On all the above
prophecies, and many more that might be quoted, the descriptions of
modern travellers furnish a perfect comment.</p>
<p>5. But it is pre&euml;minently in Christ that the prophecies of
the Old Testament have their fulfilment. As the rays of the sun in
a burning-glass all converge to one bright focus, so all the
different lines of prophecy in the Old Testament centre in the
person of Jesus of Nazareth. Separated from him they have neither
unity nor harmony; but are, like the primitive chaos, "without form
and void." But in him predictions, apparently contradictory to each
other, meet with divine unity and harmony.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id=
"page145"></a>{145}</span>
<p>He is a great <i>Prophet</i>, like Moses; the Mediator,
therefore, of the new economy, as Moses was of the old, and
revealing to the people the whole will of God. As a Prophet, the
Spirit of the Lord rests upon him, "the spirit of wisdom and
understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge and the fear of the Lord." Isa. 11:2. As a Prophet, he
receives from God the tongue of the learned, that he should know
how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. Isa. 50:4. As a
Prophet, "the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which
had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not
heard shall they consider." Isaiah 52:15.</p>
<p>He is also a mighty <i>King</i>, to whom God has given the
heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth
for his possession. He breaks the nations with a rod of iron; he
dashes them in pieces as a potter's vessel, Psa. 2:8, 9; and yet
"he shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in
the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax
shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth."
Isa. 42:2, 3. "All kings shall fall down before him: all nations
shall serve him," Psa. 72:11; and yet "he is despised and rejected
of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:" "he is
brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her
shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth." Isa. 53:3, 7. Many
other like contrasts could be added.</p>
<p>With the kingly he unites the <i>priestly</i> office. Sitting as
a king "upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
henceforth even for ever," Isa. 9:7, he is yet "a priest for ever
after the order of Melchizedek." Nor is his priestly office any
thing of subordinate importance, for he is inducted into it by the
solemn oath of Jehovah: "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent,
Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek." Psa.
110:4. As a priest he offers up himself "an offering for sin:" "he
was wounded for our transgressions, he <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>{146}</span> was
bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon
him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have
gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord
hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." Isa., ch. 53. When we
find a key that opens all the intricate wards of a lock, we know
that the key and the lock have one and the same author, and are
parts of one whole. The history of Jesus of Nazareth is the key
which unlocks all the wards of Old Testament prophecy. With this
key Moses and the prophets open to the plainest reader; without it,
they remain closed and hidden from human apprehension. We know,
therefore, that he who sent his Son Jesus Christ to be the Saviour
of the world, sent also his prophets to testify beforehand of his
coming, and of the offices which he bears for our redemption.</p>
<p>6. To sum up all in a word, we take the deepest, and therefore
the most scriptural view of the Jewish institutions and history,
when we consider the whole as a perpetual adumbration of
Christ&mdash;not Christ in his simple personality, but Christ in
his body the church. It is not meant by this that the Mosaic
economy was nothing but type. Apart from all reference to the
salvation of the gospel, it was to the Israelitish people before
the Saviour's advent a present reality meeting a present want. The
deliverance of the people from the bondage of Egypt, their passage
through the Red sea, the cloud which guided them, the manna which
fed them, the water out of the rock which they drank&mdash;all
these things were to them a true manifestation of God's presence
and favor, aside from their typical import, the apprehension of
which indeed was reserved for future ages. So also the Mosaic
institutions were to them a true body of laws for the regulation of
their commonwealth, and in their judges, kings, and prophets they
had true rulers and teachers.</p>
<p>But while all this is important to be remembered, it is also
true that the Mosaic economy was thickly sown by God's own hand
with the seeds of higher principles&mdash;those very principles
which Christ and his apostles <i>unfolded out of the law and the
prophets</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id=
"page147"></a>{147}</span> Thus it constituted a divine training by
which the people were prepared for that spiritual kingdom of heaven
which "in the fulness of time" the Saviour established. "All the
prophets and the law prophesied until John"&mdash;not the prophets
and the law in certain separate passages alone, but the prophets
and the law as a whole. They prophesied of Christ, and in Christ
their prophecy has its fulfilment.</p>
<p>7. The consideration of the <i>extent of the canon</i> of the
Old Testament does not properly belong here. It is sufficient to
say that we have no valid reason for doubting the truth of the
Jewish tradition, which assigns to Ezra and "the great synagogue"
the work of setting forth the Hebrew canon as we now have it. That
this tradition is embellished with fictions must be conceded; but
we ought not, on such a ground, to deny its substantial truth,
confirmed as it is by all the scriptural notices of Ezra's
qualifications and labors. It is certain that the canon of the Jews
in Palestine was the same in our Lord's day that it is now. The
Greek version of the Septuagint contains indeed certain apocryphal
books not extant in the Hebrew. These seem to have been in use,
more or less, among the Alexandrine Jews; but there is no evidence
that any canonical authority was ascribed to them, and it is
certain that the Jews of Palestine adhered strictly to the Hebrew
canon, which is identical with our own.</p>
<p>8. The <i>principle</i> upon which the canon of the Old
Testament was formed is not doubtful. No books were admitted into
it but those written by prophets or prophetical men. As under the
New Testament the reception or rejection of a book as canonical was
determined by the writer's relation to Christ, so was it under the
Old by his relation to the theocracy. The highest relation was held
by Moses, its mediator. He accordingly had the prophetical spirit
in the fullest measure: "If there be a prophet among you, I the
Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak
unto him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in
all mine house. With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even
apparently, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id=
"page148"></a>{148}</span> not in dark speeches; and the similitude
of the Lord shall he behold." Numb. 12:6-8. The next place was held
by prophets expressly called and commissioned by God, some of whom
also, as Samuel, administered the affairs of the theocracy.
Finally, there were the pious rulers whom God placed at the head of
the covenant people, and endowed with the spirit of prophecy, such
as David, Solomon, and Ezra. To no class of men besides those just
mentioned do the Jewish rabbins ascribe the authorship of any book
of the Old Testament, and in this respect their judgment is
undoubtedly right.</p>
<p>9. The <i>inspiration</i> of the books of the Old Testament is
everywhere assumed by our Lord and his apostles; for they argue
from them as possessing divine authority. "What is written in the
law?" "What saith the scripture?" "All things must be fulfilled
which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in
the psalms concerning me;" "This scripture must needs have been
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before concerning Judas;"
"The scripture cannot be broken"&mdash;all these and other similar
forms of expression contain the full testimony of our Lord and his
apostles to the truth elsewhere expressly affirmed of the Old
Testament, that "all scripture is given by inspiration of God," 2
Tim. 3:16, and that "the prophecy came not in the old time by the
will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21. When the Saviour asks the Pharisees in
reference to Psalm 110, "How then doth David in spirit call him
Lord?" he manifestly does not mean that this particular psalm alone
was written "in spirit," that is, under the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit; but he ascribes to it the character which belongs to the
entire book, in common with the rest of Scripture, in accordance
with the express testimony of David: "The Spirit of the Lord spake
by me, and his word was in my tongue." 2 Sam. 23:2.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id=
"page149"></a>{149}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>EVIDENCES INTERNAL AND EXPERIMENTAL.</h3>
<p>1. The external evidences of revealed religion are, in their
proper place and sphere, of the highest importance. Christianity
rests not upon theory, but upon historical facts sustained by an
overwhelming mass of testimony. It is desirable that every
Christian, so far as he has opportunity, should make himself
acquainted with this testimony for the strengthening of his own
faith and the refutation of gainsayers. Nevertheless, many
thousands of Christians are fully established in the faith of the
gospel who have but a very limited knowledge of the historical
proofs by which its divine origin is supported. To them the Bible
commends itself as the word of God by its internal character, and
the gospel as God's plan of salvation by their inward experience of
its divine power, and their outward observation of its power over
the hearts and lives of all who truly receive it. This is in
accordance with the general analogy of God's works. We might be
assured beforehand that a system of religion having God for its
author, would shine by its own light, and thus commend itself at
once to the human understanding and conscience, irrespective of all
outward testimony to its truth. Although the internal evidences of
Christianity have already been considered to some extent in
connection with those that are outward and historical, it is
desirable in the present closing chapter to offer some suggestions
pertaining to the internal character of the Bible as a whole, and
also to the testimony of Christian experience, individual and
general.</p>
<p>2. To every unperverted mind the Bible commends itself at once
as the word of God by the wonderful view which it gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id=
"page150"></a>{150}</span> of his character and providence. It
exhibits one personal God who made and governs the world, without
the least trace of polytheism on the one hand, or pantheism on the
other&mdash;the two rocks of error upon which every other system of
religion in the world has made shipwreck. And this great Spirit,
"infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power,
holiness, justice, goodness, and truth," is not removed to a
distance from us, but is ever nigh to each one of his creatures. He
is our Father in heaven, who cares for us and can hear and answer
our prayers. His providence extends to all things, great and small.
He directs alike the sparrow's flight, and the rise and fall of
empires. To the perfect view of God's character and government
which the pages of the Bible unfold, no man can add anything, and
whoever takes any thing away only mars and mutilates it. How now
shall we explain the great fact that the Hebrew people, some
thousands of years ago, had this true knowledge of God and his
providence, while it was hidden from all other nations? The Bible
gives the only reasonable answer: God himself revealed it to
them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The superficial view which accounts for the pure monotheism of
the Hebrews from their peculiar national character, is sufficiently
refuted by their history. Notwithstanding the severe penalties with
which the Mosaic code of laws visited idolatrous practices in every
form, the people were perpetually relapsing into the idolatry of
the surrounding nations, and could be cured of this propensity only
by the oft-repeated judgments of their covenant God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Next we have the wonderful code of morals contained in the
Bible. Of its perfection, we in Christian lands have but a dim
apprehension, because it is the only system of morals with which we
are familiar; but the moment we compare it with any code outside of
Christendom, its supreme excellence at once appears.</p>
<p>It is a <i>spiritual</i> code, made for the heart. It proposes
to regulate the inward affections of the soul, and through them the
outward life. Thus it lays the axe at the root of all sin.</p>
<p>It is a <i>reasonable</i> code, giving to God the first place in
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id=
"page151"></a>{151}</span> human heart, and to man only a
subordinate place. Its first and great commandment is, "Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;" its second, "Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself." Thus it lays broad and deep the
foundations of a righteous character. If any moral proposition is
self-evident, it is that such a code as this, which exalts God to
the throne of the human soul and humbles man beneath his feet, is
not the offspring of human self-love. If any one would know the
difference between the Bible and a human code of morals, let him
read Cicero's treatise <i>on Duties</i>, perhaps the best system of
ethics which pure heathenism ever produced, but from which man's
relation to deity is virtually left out.</p>
<p>It is a <i>comprehensive</i> code, not insisting upon one or two
favorite virtues, but upon all virtues. Just as the light of the
sun is white and glistering because it contains in itself, in due
proportion, all the different sorts of rays, so the morality of the
Bible shines forth, like the sun, with a pure and dazzling
brightness, because it unites in itself, in just proportion, all
the duties which men owe to God and each other.</p>
<p>Many who outwardly profess Christianity do not make the precepts
of the Bible their rule of life, or they do so only in a very
imperfect way, and thus scandal is brought upon the name of Christ,
whose servants they profess to be. But it is self-evident that he
who <i>obeys</i> the Bible in sincerity and truth is thus made a
thoroughly good man; good in his inward principles and feelings,
and good in his outward life; good in his relations to God and man;
good in prosperity and adversity, in honor and dishonor, in life
and death; a good husband and father, a good neighbor, a good
citizen. If there is ever to be a perfect state of society on
earth, it must come from simple obedience to the precepts of the
Bible, obedience full and universal. No man can conceive of any
thing more glorious and excellent than this. We may boldly
challenge the unbeliever to name a corrupt passion in the heart or
a vicious practice in the life that could remain. Let every man
love God with all his heart and his neighbor as himself, and bolts
and bars, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id=
"page152"></a>{152}</span> prisons and penitentiaries, would be
unnecessary. One might safely journey around the world unarmed and
unattended, for every man would be a friend and brother. "Glory to
God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men,"
would reign from pole to pole. The whole earth would be at rest and
be quiet: it would break forth into singing. That such a glorious
result would certainly come from simple obedience to the precepts
of the Bible is undeniable. And can any man persuade himself that
this perfect code of morals comes not from heaven, but from sinful
man?</p>
<p>4. We have, once more, the wonderful <i>harmony between the
different parts of the Bible</i>, written as it was in different
and distant ages, and by men who differed widely from each other in
natural character and education, and lived in very different states
of society. In outward form and institutions the manifestation of
God has indeed undergone great changes; for it has existed
successively under the patriarchal, the Mosaic, and the Christian
dispensations. But if we look beneath the surface to the substance
of religion in these different dispensations, we shall find it
always the same. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of
Moses, Samuel, and David, is also the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.
While he changes from time to time the outward ordinances of his
people, he remains himself "the same yesterday and to-day and for
ever." Under the Old Testament, not less than under the New, he is
"the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and
abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, and that will by no
means clear the guilty." Exod. 34:6, 7, etc. Under the New
Testament, not less than under the Old, he is to all the despisers
of his grace "a consuming fire," Heb. 12:29; and his Son Jesus
Christ, whom he sent to save the world, will be revealed hereafter
"in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Thess. 1:7,
8. If the New Testament insists on the obedience of the heart, and
not of the outward <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id=
"page153"></a>{153}</span> letter alone, the Old Testament teaches
the same doctrine: "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and
to hearken than the fat of rams." 1 Sam. 15:22. "Thou desirest not
sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt
offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." Psa. 51:16, 17. "I
will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with
thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or
bullock that hath horns and hoofs." Psa. 69:30, 31. "Take thou away
from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of
thy viols. But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness
as a mighty stream." Amos 5:23, 24. If the Old Testament insists on
obedience to all God's commandments as an indispensable condition
of salvation, so does the New: "Whosoever shall keep the whole law,
and offend in one point, he is guilty of all," James 2:10; "If thy
right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it
is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and
not that thy whole body should be cast into hell." Matt. 5:29, etc.
The Old Testament, as well as the New, teaches the doctrine of
regeneration and sanctification by the Holy Ghost: "Create in me a
clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me," Psa.
51:10. "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I
cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit
will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of
your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my
Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye
shall keep my judgments and do them." Ezek. 36:25-27. The Old
Testament, as well as the New, denounces self-righteousness in
every form, and teaches men that they are saved not for the merit
of their good works, but through God's free mercy: "Not for thy
righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go in
to possess their land," Deut. 9:5; "Not for your sakes do I this,
saith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id=
"page154"></a>{154}</span> confounded for your own ways, O house of
Israel." Ezekiel 36:32. When the holy men of the Old Testament so
often beseech God to hear and answer their prayers <i>for his
name's sake</i>, they renounce all claim to be heard on the ground
of their own merit. Faith that works by love and purifies the heart
from sin&mdash;this is the substance of the religion taught in the
Bible from Genesis to Revelation. This wonderful unity of doctrine
and spirit that pervades the books of the Bible from first to last,
finds its natural explanation in the fact that they were all
written "by inspiration of God."</p>
<p>5. The Bible is distinguished from all other books by its
<i>power over the human conscience</i>. The apostle says: "The word
of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of
the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart," Heb. 4:12; and this declaration is confirmed
by the experience of every thoughtful reader. Whoever studies the
pages of the Bible in an earnest spirit, feels that in them One
speaks who has a perfect understanding of his heart in its inmost
workings; one who knows not only what he is, but also what he ought
to be, and who therefore speaks to him with authority. The young
are sometimes advised to study certain authors, that they may thus
gain "a knowledge of men." It cannot be denied that, within the
sphere of this world, the knowledge of men which some of these
writers possess is admirable. But the Bible contains not only all
this knowledge in its most complete and practical form, but also,
what is wanting in the authors referred to, a perfect knowledge of
men in their higher relation to God. With wonderful accuracy does
the Bible describe men's character and conduct as citizens of this
world. But here it does not stop. It regards them as subjects of
God's everlasting government, and thus as citizens of eternity
also; and it portrays in vivid and truthful colors the way in which
they harden their hearts, blind their minds, and stupefy their
consciences by their continued wilful resistance of God's claim to
their supreme love and obedience. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page155" id="page155"></a>{155}</span> In a word, it describes men
in their relation to God as well as to their fellow-men; and every
man who reads the description, hears within his soul the still
small voice of conscience saying, "Thou art the man." Whence this
all-comprehensive knowledge of man contained in the Bible? The
answer is: He who made man has described man in his own word with
infallible accuracy; "because he knew all men, and needed not that
any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man."</p>
<p>6. We come now to the argument from <i>personal experience</i>.
To receive Christ in sincerity and truth, is to know that his
salvation is from God. Many thousands have thus a full and joyous
conviction of the truth of Christianity. They were oppressed with a
deep consciousness of guilt, which no tears of sorrow or supposed
good works could remove. But they read in the Holy Scriptures that
Jesus is "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world."
They put their trust in his atoning sacrifice, and thus obtained
peace of conscience, and joyous access in prayer to God as their
Father in heaven. They were earthly in their affections, and able
therefore to render to God's holy and spiritual law only an
obedience of the letter, which they knew would not be acceptable.
But through faith in Christ they have been lifted up to a holy and
blessed communion with God, and thus enabled to render to God's law
an obedience of love "in the spirit and not in the letter." They
were oppressed with a painful sense of the empty and unsatisfying
nature of every thing earthly; but they have found in Christ and
his glorious service an all-sufficient portion. In a word, they are
assured that the gospel is from God, because it meets all their
wants as sinners. They have the same evidence that God made the
gospel for the immortal soul, as that he made bread for the
stomach, air for the lungs, and light for the eyes. The sincere
believer has in himself the witness that the gospel is from heaven,
for he is daily experiencing its healing, strengthening, and
purifying power. To tell him that the Bible is a cunningly devised
fable, is like telling a man who daily feeds on "the finest of the
wheat," and is nourished and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page156" id="page156"></a>{156}</span> strengthened by it, that
the field of golden grain which waves before his door is only
wormwood and gall; or that the pure water from the bosom of the
earth which daily quenches his thirst is a deadly poison; or that
the blessed air of heaven which fans his lungs is a pestilential
vapor. Not until error becomes the nutriment of the soul and truth
its destruction, can this argument from personal experience be set
aside or gainsaid.</p>
<p>7. The argument from the <i>character of Jesus</i> has already
been considered at length in chap, 4, No. 8. It is sufficient to
repeat here that the very description of such a character, so
gloriously perfect, so far above all that the greatest minds of
antiquity ever conceived, is itself a proof of its reality. Very
plain men may describe what they have actually seen and heard. But
that any man left to himself&mdash;and God would not help in a work
of error and delusion&mdash;should have conceived of such a
character as that of Jesus of Nazareth, without the reality before
him, is impossible; how much more that four unlettered men should
have consistently carried out the conception in such a life as that
recorded by the four evangelists.</p>
<p>8. Passing now from individual to <i>general experience</i>, we
find another proof of the divine origin of the Bible in the power
of the gospel&mdash;which includes in itself the whole word of
God&mdash;over the human heart. This is closely connected with the
preceding head, since the Christian's religion takes the shape of
personal love towards the Saviour&mdash;love which is awakened in
the sinner's soul, as the New Testament teaches, by the Holy Spirit
revealing to him his lost condition and the character and offices
of the Redeemer, whereby he is drawn into an inward spiritual union
with him. This love of Jesus is the <i>mightiest principle on
earth</i> for both doing and suffering. The man of whose soul it
has taken full possession is invincible, not in his own strength,
but in the strength of Him to whom he has given his supreme
confidence and affection. No hardships, privations, or dangers can
deter him from Christ's service; no persecutions can drive him from
it. In the early days of Christianity, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>{157}</span> at the
period of the Reformation, in many missionary fields in our own
time, not only strong men, but tender women and children, have
steadfastly endured shame and suffering in every
form&mdash;banishment and the spoiling of their goods,
imprisonment, torture, and death&mdash;for Christ's sake. In times
of worldly peace and prosperity, the power of this principle is
dimly seen; but were the Christians of this day required, under
penalty of imprisonment, confiscation, and death, to deny Christ,
it would at once manifest itself. Many would apostatize, because
they are believers only in name; but true believers would remain
steadfast, as in the days of old. It is a fact worthy of special
notice, that persecution not only fails to conquer those who love
Jesus, but it fails also to hinder others from embracing his
religion. It has first a winnowing power. It separates from the
body of the faithful those who are Christians only in name. Then
the manifestation of Christian faith and patience by those who
remain steadfast, draws men from the world without to Christ. Hence
the maxim, as true as trite, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed
of the church." The Christian religion at the beginning had no
worldly advantages, and it was opposed by all the power of imperial
Rome in alliance with the heathen priesthood. Had it been possible
that any combination of men should crush it, it must have perished
at the outset; but it only grew stronger in the midst of its fierce
and powerful enemies. It went through ten bloody persecutions,
"conquering and to conquer," until it overthrew paganism, and
became the established religion of the Roman empire. Then it was
not strengthened by its alliance with the state, but only corrupted
and shorn of its true power. And so it has been ever since. The
gospel has always shown itself mightiest to subdue men to Christ,
when it has been compelled to rely most exclusively on its own
divinely furnished strength. What the apostle said of himself
personally, the gospel which he preached can say with equal truth:
"When I am weak, then am I strong." How shall we account for this
fact? The only reasonable explanation is, that God is the author of
the gospel, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id=
"page158"></a>{158}</span> and his power is in it, so that it is
able to overcome the world without any help from without. Were it
the invention of man, we might reasonably expect that it would be
greatly strengthened by an alliance with the kings and rulers of
the world, instead of being thereby corrupted and weakened, as we
find to be the invariable result. Because God made the gospel, and
not men, when it is left free to work according to his appointment,
it is mighty in its power over the human heart; but the moment
worldly men take it under their patronage, that they may make it
subservient to their worldly ends, they bind it in fetters, and
would kill it, had it not a divine and indestructible life.</p>
<p>9. We notice, further, that the same love of Jesus which makes
men invincible to the world without, also enables them to
<i>conquer their own corrupt passions</i>, and this is the greater
victory of the two. It is easy to declaim on the sins and
inconsistencies of visible Christians. The church of Christ, like
every thing administered by men, is imperfect. Unworthy men find
their way into it, making it, as the great Master foretold, a field
in which wheat and tares grow together. Nevertheless, wherever the
gospel is preached in its purity, bright examples are found of its
power to reclaim the vicious, to make the proud humble, and the
earthly-minded heavenly. It draws all who truly receive it, by a
gradual but certain process, into a likeness to Christ, which is
the sum of all goodness. In proportion also as the principles of
the gospel gain ground in any community, they ennoble it, purify
it, and inspire it with the spirit of truth and justice. Very
imperfectly is our country pervaded by this good leaven. Yet it is
this, small as is its measure, which makes the difference between
the state of society here at home and in India or China. Many
thousands who do not personally receive the gospel thus experience
its elevating power. They receive at its hand innumerable precious
gifts without understanding or acknowledging the source from which
they come.</p>
<p>10. As a final argument, may be named the power of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id=
"page159"></a>{159}</span> Christian religion to <i>purify
itself</i> from the corruptions introduced into it by men. It is
not alone from the world without that Christ's church has been
assailed. Corrupt men have arisen within her pale who have set
themselves to deny or explain away her essential doctrines, to
change her holy practice, or to crush and overlay her with a load
of superstitious observances. But the gospel cannot be destroyed by
inward any more than by outward enemies. From time to time it
asserts its divine origin and invincible power, by bursting the
bands imposed on it by men, and throwing off their human additions,
thus reappearing in its native purity and strength. So it did on a
broad scale at the era of the Reformation, and so it has often done
since in narrower fields.</p>
<p>10. Let now the candid inquirer ask himself whether a book which
gives such gloriously perfect views of God's character and
government; whose code of morals is so spotlessly pure that simple
obedience to it is the sum of all goodness, and would, if full and
universal, make this world a moral paradise; all whose parts,
though written in different and distant ages by men of such
diversified character and training, are in perfect harmony with
each other; which displays such a wonderful knowledge of man in all
his relations to God and his fellow-men, and therefore speaks with
such authority and power to his conscience; which reveals a
religion that satisfies all the wants of those who embrace it, that
makes them victorious alike over outward persecution and inward
sinful passion, and that asserts its invincible power by throwing
off from itself the corrupt additions of men&mdash;whether such a
book can possibly have man for its author. Assuredly in character
it resembles not sinful man, but the holy God. It must be from
heaven, for it is heavenly in all its features.</p>

<hr />
<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id=
"page163"></a>{163}</span>
<h2>PREFATORY REMARKS.</h2>
<hr />
<p>To consider at length all the questions which the spirit of
modern inquiry has raised concerning the books of the Old
Testament&mdash;their genuineness, integrity, date, chronology, and
credibility; their relation to science, to profane history, to each
other, and to the New Testament&mdash;would far exceed the limits
allowed by the plan of the present work. To the Pentateuch alone,
or even a single book of it, as Genesis or Deuteronomy; to the
books of Chronicles; to Isaiah or Daniel, a whole volume might be
devoted without exhausting the subject. In the present Introduction
to the books of the Old Testament, the aim has been to give the
results of biblical research, ancient and modern, with a concise
statement of the lines of argument employed, wherever this could be
done without involving discussions intelligible only to those who
are familiar with the original languages of Scripture and the
ancient versions. For such discussions the biblical student is
referred to the more extended Introductions which abound at the
present day. The author has endeavored, first of all, to direct the
reader's attention to the <i>unity of Scripture</i>. "Known unto
God are all his works from the beginning of the world." The plan of
Redemption is the very highest of these works, and it constitutes a
gloriously perfect whole, gradually unfolding itself from age to
age. The earliest revelations have reference to all that follow.
The later revelations shed light on the earlier, and receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id=
"page164"></a>{164}</span> light from them in return. It is only
when the Scriptures are thus studied as a whole, that any one part
of them can be truly comprehended. The effort has accordingly been
made to show the relation of the Old Testament, considered as a
whole, to the New; then, the relation of the several great
divisions of the Old Testament&mdash;the law, the historical books,
the prophets, the poetical books&mdash;to each other, and the place
which each holds in the system of revelation; and finally, the
office of each particular book, with such notices of its
authorship, date, general plan, and contents, as will prepare the
reader to study it intelligently and profitably. To all who would
have a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the <i>New</i>
Testament, the diligent study of the preparatory revelation
contained in the <i>Old</i>, is earnestly commended. The present
Introduction will be followed by one to the New Testament on the
same general plan. It is hardly necessary to add that for much of
the materials employed, in these two parts, particularly what
relates to ancient manuscripts, the author is dependent on the
statements of those who have had the opportunity of making original
investigations.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id=
"page165"></a>{165}</span>
<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT.</h2>
<h3>FIRST DIVISION, GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>NAMES AND EXTERNAL FORM OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h3>
<p>1. The word <i>Bible</i> comes to us from the Greek (<i>ta
biblia, the books</i>; that is, emphatically, the sacred canonical
books) through the Latin and Norman French. In the ancient Greek
and Latin churches, its use, as a plural noun applied to the whole
collection of sacred books of the Old and New Testaments, can be
traced as far back as the fifth century. In the English, as in all
the modern languages of Europe, it has become a singular noun, and
thus signifies <span class="smcap">the Book</span>&mdash;the one
book containing in itself all the particular books of the sacred
canon.</p>
<p>In very ancient usage, the word <i>Law</i> (Heb. <i>Torah</i>)
was applied to the five books of Moses; but there was no general
term to denote the whole collection of inspired writings till after
the completion of the canon of the Old Testament, when they were
known in Jewish usage as: <i>The Law</i>, <i>the Prophets</i>, and
the <i>Writings</i> (see below, No. 5). In accordance with the same
usage, the writers of the New Testament speak of the "law and the
prophets," and more fully, "the law of Moses, and the prophets, and
the psalms," Luke 24:44. And they apply to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>{166}</span> the
collected writings of the Old Testament, as well as to particular
passages, the term <i>the Scripture</i>, that is, <i>the
writings</i>, thus: "The Scripture saith," John 7:38, etc. Or they
employ the plural number: "Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures,"
Matt. 22:29, etc. Once the epithet <i>holy</i> is added, 2 Tim.
3:15.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2 Pet. 3:16, the term <i>Scriptures</i> is applied to at
least the epistles of Paul; apparently also to the other canonical
writings of the New Testament then extant. In the usage of
Christian writers, the application of this term to the books of the
New Testament soon became well established; but the above is the
only example of such an application that occurs in the New
Testament itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. The terms <i>Old</i> and <i>New Testament</i> arose in the
following way: God's dealings with the Israelitish people, under
both the patriarchs and Moses, took the form of a <i>covenant</i>;
that is, not a mutual agreement as between two equal parties, but
an <i>arrangement</i> or <i>dispensation</i>, in which God himself,
as the sovereign Lord, propounded to the chosen people certain
terms, and bound himself, upon condition of the fulfilment of these
terms, to bestow upon them blessings temporal and spiritual. Now
the Greek word <i>diatheke</i>, by which the Septuagint renders the
Hebrew word for <i>covenant</i>, signifies both <i>covenant</i>, in
the general sense above given, and <i>testament</i>, as being the
final disposition which a man makes of his worldly estate. The new
covenant introduced by Christ is, in a sense, a <i>testament</i>,
as being ratified by his bloody death. Matt. 26:28; Mark 14:24;
Luke 22:20. So it is expressly called in the epistle to the
Hebrews, 9:15-17, where the new covenant, considered in the light
of a testament, is contrasted with the old. It was probably in
connection with this view that the <i>Old Latin</i> version of the
Bible (made in the Old Testament not from the original Hebrew, but
from the Greek Septuagint) everywhere rendered the Greek word
<i>diatheke</i> by the Latin <i>testamentum</i>. When Jerome
undertook the work of correcting this version, he did not
everywhere pursue the same plan. The books of the Old Testament he
rendered in general from the Hebrew; and here he employed for the
Hebrew word denoting <i>covenant</i> the appropriate Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id=
"page167"></a>{167}</span> words <i>foedus</i> and <i>pactum</i>.
But in the Psalms, and the whole New Testament, from deference to
established usage, he gave simply a revision of the Old Latin,
leaving the word <i>testamentum</i>, by which that version had
rendered the word <i>diatheke</i>, <i>covenant</i>, untouched.
Hence in Latin usage we have in the New Testament the two
covenants, the old and the new, expressed by the terms <i>old
testament</i> (<i>vetus testamentum</i>, <i>prius</i> or <i>primum
testamentum</i>) and <i>new testament</i> (<i>novum
testamentum</i>), and sometimes in immediate contrast with each
other, as in 2 Cor. 3:6, 14; Heb. 9:15-18. The transfer of these
terms from the covenants themselves to the writings which give an
account of them was easy, and soon became established in general
usage. Hence the terms <i>Old</i> and <i>New Testament</i> for the
two great divisions of the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another Latin term for the two great divisions of the Bible was
<i>instrumentum</i>, <i>instrument</i>, <i>document</i>; a term
applied to the documents or body of records relating to the Roman
empire, and very appropriate, therefore, to the records of God's
dealings with men. But as early as the time of Tertullian, about
the close of the second century, the word <i>testamentum</i>,
<i>testament</i>, was more in use. See Tertullian against Marcion,
4. 1. A striking example of the superior accuracy of Jerome's
independent version above his simple revision of the old Latin is
the passage Jer. 31:31-33 as compared with the quotation of the
same, Heb. 8:8-10. In the former, where the translation is made
immediately from the Hebrew, we read: "Behold the days shall come,
saith the Lord, that I will make for the house of Israel and the
house of Judah a new <i>covenant</i> (<i>foedus</i>): not according
to the <i>covenant</i> (<i>pactum</i>) which I made with their
fathers," etc. In the same passage, as quoted in the epistle to the
Hebrews, where we have only a revision of the old Latin, we read:
"Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, that I will accomplish
for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new
<i>testament</i> (<i>testamentum</i>): not according to the
<i>testament</i> (<i>testamentum</i>) which I made for their
fathers," etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. The <i>unity</i> of the Bible has its ground only in divine
inspiration. So far as human composition is concerned, both parts
of it have a great variety of authors. The writers of the Old
Testament, especially, lived in different, and some of them in very
distant ages. They were widely separated from each other in native
character and endowments, in education, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>{168}</span> in their
outward circumstances and position in life. It is of the highest
importance that the student of Scripture not only know these facts,
but ponder them long and carefully, till he fully understands their
deep significance. He has been accustomed from childhood to see all
the books of the Bible comprised within the covers of a single
volume. He can hardly divest himself of the idea that their
authors, if not exactly contemporary, must yet somehow have
understood each other's views and plans, and acted in mutual
concert. It is only by long contemplation that he is able to
apprehend the true position which these writers held to each other,
separated from each other, as they often were, by centuries of
time, during which great changes took place in the social and
political condition of the Hebrew people. Then, for the first time,
he begins to discern, in the wonderful harmony that pervades the
writings of the Old Testament, taken as a whole, the clear proofs
of a superintending divine Spirit; and learns to refer this harmony
to its true ground, that "holy men of God spake as they were moved
by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the received chronology, Moses wrote the book of
Deuteronomy about 1451 B.C, and Malachi, the last of the prophets,
wrote about 397 B.C. The difference, then, between the time of
these two authors is 1054 years; or say, in round numbers, about
1000 years. From Moses to the anointing of David is, according to
the shorter chronology, 388 years; and from Moses to the
composition of the books of Kings, nearly nine centuries. From Joel
to Malachi we must assume a period of about 400 years, within which
space our present prophetical books were composed. The earlier of
the psalms written by David differ in time from those composed at
the close of the captivity by about 530 years. Let the reader who
has been in the habit of passing from one book of the Bible to
another, as if both belonged to the same age, ponder well the
meaning of these figures. They confirm the arguments already
adduced (ch. 12, No. 4) that the unity of Scripture has its ground
not in human concert, but in the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. The books of the Old Testament have been differently
classified and arranged. But in no system of distribution has the
chronological order been strictly observed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id=
"page169"></a>{169}</span>
<p>(A.) <i>The Jewish classification and arrangement</i> is as
follows. They first distribute the books of the Old Testament into
three great classes, the <i>Law</i>, the <i>Prophets</i>, and the
<i>Writings</i>; that is, the canonical writings not included in
the other two divisions&mdash;the <i>Hagiographa</i> (<i>holy
writings</i>), as they are commonly designated at the present
day.</p>
<p>The <i>Law</i> is then subdivided into five books, as we now
have them; for the names of which see the introduction to the
Pentateuch. Chap. 19, No. 1.</p>
<p>With reference to this five-fold division of the Law, the
Rabbins call it <i>the five-fifths of the Law</i>, each book being
reckoned as one-fifth. This term answers to the word
<i>Pentateuch</i>, that is, <i>the five-fold book</i>. Chap. 9,
beginning.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> great class consists of the so-called
<i>Prophets</i>. These are first divided into the <i>former</i> and
the <i>latter</i> Prophets. The former Prophets consist of the
historical books: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, in the order
named. The latter comprise the prophetical books in the stricter
sense of the word, with the exception of Daniel; and these are
subdivided into the <i>greater</i> and the <i>less</i>. The greater
Prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. The less are the twelve
Minor Prophets from Hosea to Malachi, in the same order as that
followed in our English version.</p>
<p>The remaining books of the Old Testament constitute the
<i>third</i> great class, under the name of <i>Writings</i>,
<i>Hagiographa</i>; and they are commonly arranged in the following
order: Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations,
Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles. These
books naturally fall into three groups. <i>First</i>, devotional
and didactic&mdash;the three so-called poetical books of Psalms,
Proverbs, and Job, which have in Hebrew a stricter rhythm;
<i>secondly</i>, the five rolls&mdash;Canticles, Ruth,
Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther; so called because written on
five separate rolls for use in the synagogue service on the
occasion of special festivals; <i>thirdly</i>, books that are
chiefly of an historical character&mdash;Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah,
and Chronicles.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id=
"page170"></a>{170}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>The Talmud arranges the Greater Prophets thus: Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, Isaiah. Of the Hagiographa, various other arrangements,
Masoretic and Talmudic, are given, which it is not necessary here
to specify.</p>
<p>That the writing of sacred history belonged to the prophetical
office is clear from various scriptural notices. Compare 1 Chron.
29:29; 2 Chron, 9:29; 12:15; 20:34; 26:22; 32:32, 33:19. The
narrative concerning Sennacherib inserted in the second book of
Kings (18:13-19:37) is manifestly from the pen of Isaiah. The
Rabbins rightly ascribed the composition of the historical as well
as the other books which compose, according to their division, the
<i>Prophets</i>, to prophetical men. But the grounds upon which
they separated from these certain books, as, for example, Daniel,
and placed them among the Hagiographa, are not clear. Some of the
rabbins made the distinction to lie in the <i>degree of
inspiration</i>, Moses enjoying it in the fullest measure (Numb.
12:6-8), the authors of the books which are classed among the
prophets having <i>the Spirit of prophecy</i>, and those of the
books belonging to the Hagiographa simply <i>the Holy Spirit</i>
(the Holy Spirit, but not in the degree necessary for prophetic
revelation). But this distinction is untenable. Who had the spirit
of prophecy if not Daniel? In the opinion of some modern scholars,
they reckoned to the Prophets only books written by men who were
prophets in the stricter sense of the term; that is, men trained to
the prophetical office, and exercising it as their profession;
while the writings of men like David, Solomon, and Daniel, who
though they had the Spirit of prophecy, were yet in their office
not prophets, but rulers and statesmen, were assigned to the
Hagiographa. But this is inconsistent with the fact that the book
of Ruth (which in respect to authorship must go with that of
Judges) and also the book of Lamentations are in the Hagiographa.
Others, with more probability, find the main ground of
classification in the character of the writings
themselves&mdash;the <i>Law</i>, as the foundation of the
Theocracy; the <i>Prophets</i>, that record the history of the
Theocracy and make prophetic revelations concerning it; the sacred
<i>Writings</i>, occupied with the personal appropriation of the
truths of revelation, and as such exhibiting the religious life of
the covenant people in its inward and outward form. But even here
we do not find perfect consistency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(B.) <i>Classification of the Greek Version of the Seventy.</i>
The ancient Greek version of the Old Testament, called the
<i>Septuagint</i> (Latin <i>Septuaginta</i>, <i>seventy</i>),
because, according to Jewish tradition, it was the work of seventy
men, interweaves the <i>apocryphal</i> with the <i>canonical</i>
books. Its arrangement is as follows, the apocryphal books and
parts of books being indicated by italic letters. We follow the
edition of Van Ess from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"

apocryphal Prayer of Manasseh:</p>

<p>The arrangement of books in the Latin <i>Vulgate</i> agrees with
that of the Septuagint with the following exceptions: the two
canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah appear together, as in the
Septuagint, but under the titles of 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras. Next
follow the two apocryphal books of Esdras (the latter wanting in
the Septuagint), under the titles of 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras. The
Greater Prophets, with Lamentations after Jeremiah and Daniel after
Ezekiel, are inserted before the twelve Minor Prophets, which last
stand in the order followed in our version. Throwing out of
account, therefore, the apocryphal <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page172" id="page172"></a>{172}</span> books, the order of the
Vulgate is that followed by our English Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the above it is manifest that in neither the Hebrew, the
Greek, nor the Latin arrangement is the <i>order of time</i>
strictly followed. The Hebrew, for example, to say nothing of the
Psalms, which were written in different ages, throws into the
Hagiographa Ruth, Job, Proverbs, etc., which are older than any of
the so-called latter prophets. The Hebrew places the books of
Kings, and the Greek and Latin not only these, but also the books
of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, before all the proper
prophetical books, though it is well known that several of these
were much earlier. In the Hebrew arrangement, the three Greater
Prophets precede all the Minor Prophets, though several of the
latter were earlier than Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and even Isaiah. In
the Greek, on the contrary, Isaiah and Jeremiah, as well as
Ezekiel, are placed after even the prophets of the Restoration. The
biblical student should carefully remember these facts. He must not
hastily assume that the books of the Old Testament stand in the
order in which they were written, but must determine the age of
each for itself, according to the best light that he can obtain.
See further in the introductions to the several books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. In high antiquity, the <i>continuous mode of writing</i>,
(<i>scriptio continua</i>,) without divisions between the words,
was common. We cannot indeed infer, from the continuous writing of
the oldest manuscripts of the New Testament, that the same method
prevailed in the ancient Hebrew writing; for in very ancient
inscriptions and manuscripts, belonging to different languages, the
words are distinguished from each other more or less completely by
points. Yet the neglect of these is common. In most Greek and
Phoenician inscriptions there is no division of words. The
translators of the Septuagint may be reasonably supposed to have
employed the best manuscripts at their command. Yet their version
shows that in these the words were either not separated at all, or
only partially. The complete separation of words by intervening
spaces did not take place till after the introduction of the
<i>Assyrian</i>, or <i>square</i> character. Ch. 14, No. 2. With
the separation is connected the use of the so-called <i>final</i>
letters, that is, forms of certain letters employed exclusively at
the ends of words.</p>
<p>6. A very <i>ancient Jewish division</i> of the sacred text is
into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id=
"page173"></a>{173}</span> <i>open</i> and <i>closed</i> sections.
The former, which are the larger of the two, are so named because
in the Hebrew manuscripts, and in some printed editions, the
remainder of the line at their close is left <i>open</i>, the next
section beginning with a new line. The <i>closed</i> sections, on
the contrary, are separated from each other only by a space in the
middle of a line&mdash;<i>shut in</i> on either hand. The origin of
these sections is obscure. They answer in a general way to our
sections and paragraphs, and are older than the Talmud, which
contains several references to them, belonging at least to the
earliest time when the sacred books were read in public. Davidson,
Biblical Criticism, vol. 1, ch. 5.</p>
<p>Different from these, and later in their origin, are the
<i>larger sections of the Law</i>, called <i>Parshiyoth</i> (from
the singular <i>Parashah</i>, <i>section</i>), which have exclusive
reference to the reading of the Law in the synagogue service. These
are fifty-four in number, one for each Sabbath of the Jewish
intercalary year, while on common years two of the smaller sections
are united. Corresponding to these sections of the Law are sections
from the <i>Prophets</i>, (the former and latter, according to the
Jewish classification,) called <i>Haphtaroth</i>, embracing,
however, only selections from the prophets, and not the whole, as
do the sections of the Law. The Jewish tradition is that this
custom was first introduced during the persecution of Antiochus
Epiphanes, (about 167 B.C.,) because the reading of the Law had
been prohibited by him. But this account of the matter is doubted
by many.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Pentateuch, the smaller sections called open and closed
are indicated, the former by the Hebrew letter [Hebrew: P], that
is, P, the initial letter of the word <i>pethuhah</i>, <i>open</i>;
the latter by the Hebrew letter [Hebrew: S]=S, the first letter of
the word <i>sethumah</i>, <i>closed</i>. The larger sections,
arranged for the reading of the Law in the synagogues, are
indicated by three [Hebrew: P]'s or three [Hebrew: S]'s, according
as they coincide at their beginning with an open or closed section.
In the other portions of the sacred text these divisions are simply
indicated by the appropriate spaces. But some printed editions do
not observe the distinction between the two in respect to space, so
that the open and closed sections are confounded with each
other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. <i>Chapters and Verses.</i> The division of the
<i>poetical</i> books and passages of the Old Testament into
separate <i>lines</i>, Hebrew, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page174" id="page174"></a>{174}</span> <i>pesukim</i>, (answering
in general to our half-verses, sometimes to the third of a verse,)
is very ancient, if not primitive. It is found in the poetical
passages of the Law and the historical books, (Exod., ch. 15;
Deut., ch. 32; Judges, ch. 5; 2 Sam. ch. 22,) and belonged
originally to the three books of Job, Psalms, and Proverbs, which
alone the Hebrews reckon as poetical. See below, Ch. 21, No. 1. The
division of the whole Old Testament into <i>verses</i>, (likewise
called by the Hebrews <i>pesukim</i>,) is also the work of Jewish
scholars. It existed in its completeness in the ninth century, and
must have had its origin much earlier in the necessity that grew
out of the public reading and interpretation of the sacred books in
the synagogue service.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew text the verses are distinguished by two points
called <i>soph-pasuk</i> (:), except in the synagogue rolls, where,
according to ancient usage, this mark of distinction is
omitted.</p>
<p>The present division into <i>chapters</i> is much later, and is
the work of Christian scholars. By some it is ascribed to Stephen
Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, who died in 1227; by others to
Cardinal Hugo de St. Cher of the same century. The Jews transferred
it from the Latin Vulgate to the Hebrew text. There are, however,
some discrepancies between the chapters of the Hebrew text and
those of the Vulgate and our English version.</p>
<p>The division of the sacred text into chapters and verses is
indispensable for convenience of reference. But the student should
remember that these distinctions are wholly of human origin, and
sometimes separate passages closely connected in meaning. The first
verse, for example, of Isaiah, ch. 4, is immediately connected in
sense with the threatenings against "the daughters of Zion"
contained in the close of the preceding chapter In the beginning of
ch. 11 of the same book, the words: "And there shall come forth a
rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his
roots," contrast the Branch of the Messiah with the Assyrian bough,
the lopping off of which has just been foretold; chap. 10:33, 34.
The last three verses, again, of Isaiah, ch. 52, evidently belong
to the following chapter. The connections of the sacred text,
therefore, must be determined independently of these human
distinctions.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id=
"page175"></a>{175}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>THE ORIGINAL TEXT AND ITS HISTORY.</h3>
<p>1. The original language of the Old Testament is <i>Hebrew</i>,
with the exception of certain portions of Ezra and Daniel and a
single verse of Jeremiah, (Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26; Dan. 2:4, from
the middle of the verse to end of chap. 7; Jer. 10:11,) which are
written in the cognate <i>Chaldee</i> language. The Hebrew belongs
to a stock of related languages commonly called <i>Shemitic</i>,
because spoken mainly by the descendants of Shem. Its main
divisions are: (1,) the <i>Arabic</i>, having its original seat in
the southeastern part of the Shemitic territory, and of which the
&AElig;thiopic is a branch; (2,) the <i>Aram&aelig;an</i> in the
north and northeast, comprising the eastern Aram&aelig;an or
<i>Chaldee</i>, and the western or <i>Syriac</i>; (3,) the
<i>Hebrew</i>, occupying a middle place between the two. The
<i>Samaritan</i> is essentially Aram&aelig;an, but with an
intermixture of Hebrew forms; the <i>Phoenician</i>, or
<i>Punic</i>, on the other hand, is most closely allied to the
Hebrew. All these languages, with the exception of the
&AElig;thiopic, are written from right to left, and exhibit many
peculiarities of orthography and grammatical forms and
structure.</p>
<p>2. The Hebrew characters in present use, called the
<i>Assyrian</i>, or <i>square writing</i>, are not those originally
employed. The earlier form is undoubtedly represented by the
inscriptions on the coins struck by the Maccabees, of which the
letters bear a strong resemblance to the Samaritan and Phoenician
characters. The Jewish tradition is that the present square
character was introduced by Ezra, and that it was of Assyrian
origin. The question of the correctness of this tradition has been
much discussed. Some wholly reject it, and hold that the present
square writing came by a gradual process of change from a more
ancient type. See Davidson's Bib. Crit., vol. I, ch. 3.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id=
"page176"></a>{176}</span>
<p>That the present square writing existed in our Saviour's day has
been argued with much force from Matth. 5:18, where the Saviour
says: "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot (<i>iota</i>) or one
tittle (<i>keraia</i>) shall in no wise pass from the law, till all
be fulfilled." The <i>iota</i> (Hebrew <i>yod</i>) is the letter
<i>i</i> or <i>y</i>, which in the square writing is the smallest
in the alphabet ([Hebrew: y]), but not in the ancient Hebrew,
Ph[oe]nician, or Samaritan. The <i>keraia</i>, <i>little turn</i>,
is that which distinguishes one letter from another; as [Hebrew:
d], <i>d</i>, from [Hebrew: r], <i>r</i>; or [Hebrew: b], <i>b</i>,
from [Hebrew: k], <i>k</i>. See Alford on Matth. 5:18. (The recent
discovery in the Crimea of inscriptions on the tombs of Caraite
Jews, some of them dating back, it is alleged, to the first
century, proves that the Assyrian or square character was then in
use. In these inscriptions the <i>Yod</i> (iota) is represented by
a simple point. See Alexander's Kitto, vol. 3, p. 1173.)</p>
<p>The <i>Rabbinic</i> is a modification of the Assyrian or square
writing, for the purpose of giving it a more cursive character.</p>
<p>3. The <i>Hebrew alphabet</i>, like all the other Shemitic
alphabets&mdash;with the exception of the &AElig;thiopic, which is
<i>syllabic</i>, the vowels being indicated by certain
modifications in the forms of the consonants&mdash;was originally a
skeleton alphabet, an alphabet of consonants, in which, however,
certain letters, called vowel-letters, performed in a measure the
office of vowels. The Shemite did not separate the vowels from the
consonants, and express them, as we do, by separate signs. He
rather conceived of the vowels as inhering in the
consonants&mdash;as modifications in the utterance of the
consonants, which the reader could make for himself. Various
particulars in respect to the pronunciation of certain consonants
were, in like manner, left to the reader's own knowledge. For
example, the three Hebrew letters, [Hebrew: sh], <i>sh</i>;
[Hebrew: m], <i>m</i>; [Hebrew: r], <i>r</i>, ([Hebrew: shmr], to
be read from right to left,) might be pronounced, <i>shamar</i>,
<i>he kept</i>; <i>shemor</i>, <i>keep thou</i>; <i>shomer</i>,
<i>keeping</i>&mdash;the reader determining from the connection
which of these forms should be used, just as we decide in English
between the different pronunciations of the word <i>bow</i>. As
long as the Hebrew remained a living language, that is, the
language of the masses of the people, this outline alphabet was
sufficient for all practical purposes. The modern Arabs read
without difficulty their ordinary books, which omit, in like
manner, the signs for the vowels. The regularity of structure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id=
"page177"></a>{177}</span> which belongs to the Shemitic languages
generally, makes this omission less inconvenient for them than a
like omission would be for us in our western tongues.</p>
<p>4. During the long Babylonish captivity the mass of the Jewish
people, who were born and educated in Babylon and the adjacent
regions, adopted of necessity the language of the country; that is,
the Aram&aelig;an or Chaldee language. After the exile, the Hebrew
was indeed spoken and written by the prophets and learned men, but
not by the people at large. In Nehemiah 8:8 we are told that "they
read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense,
and caused them to understand the reading." This has been explained
by some as meaning simply that they expounded to them the sense.
But the more natural meaning is that they <i>interpreted</i> to the
people the words read from the law. We find, soon after the
captivity at least, the old Hebrew supplanted as a living language
among the people at large by the Aram&aelig;an or Chaldee. Why not
date the change from the latter part of the captivity itself?</p>
<p>It was natural that the prophets and historians, all of whom
wrote soon after the exile, should employ the sacred language of
their fathers. This fact cannot be adduced as a valid argument that
the body of the people continued to speak Hebrew. The
incorporation, on the other hand, of long passages in Chaldee into
the books of Daniel and Ezra implies at least that this language
was known to the people at large. As to the children spoken of in
Neh. 13:24, who "could not speak in the Jews' language, but
according to the language of each people"&mdash;the people, to wit,
to which their mothers belonged&mdash;"the Jews' language" here is
probably the language used by the Jews, as distinguished from that
used by the people of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. Keil, Introduction
to Old Testament, &sect; 18.</p>
<p>5. After the Hebrew had ceased to be the language of the common
people, its traditional pronunciation was carefully preserved for
many successive centuries in the synagogue-reading. It was not till
several centuries after Christ (somewhere between the sixth and the
tenth centuries) that the vowel-signs and other marks of
distinction were added in order to perpetuate, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>{178}</span> with all
possible accuracy, the solemn traditional pronunciation of the
synagogue. This work is ascribed to learned Jews of Tiberias,
called <i>Masoretes</i>, from <i>Masora</i>, <i>tradition</i>; and
the Hebrew text thus furnished by them is called the
<i>Masoretic</i>, in distinction from the <i>unpointed</i> text,
which latter is, according to Jewish usage, retained in the
synagogue-rolls. From reverence to the word of God, the
<i>punctuators</i> (as these men are also called) left the
primitive text in all cases undisturbed, simply superadding to it
their marks of distinction. After giving with great minuteness the
different <i>vowel-signs</i> and marks (commonly called
<i>diacritical</i>) for the varying pronunciation of the
consonants, they superadded a complicated system of <i>accents</i>.
These serve the threefold office of guides in <i>cantillating</i>
the sacred text (according to ancient usage in the
synagogue-reading); of indicating the <i>connection in meaning</i>
among the words and clauses; and of marking, though with certain
exceptions, the <i>tone-syllables</i> of words. In addition to all
the above, they added a mass of <i>notes</i>, partly of a critical
and partly of a grammatical character, relating to various
readings, grammatical forms and connections, modes of orthography,
and the like. These are called collectively the <i>Masorah</i>, of
which there is a fuller Masorah called the <i>greater</i> (found
only in Rabbinical Bibles), and a briefer, called the <i>less</i>,
the main part of which is found in common editions of the Hebrew
Bible. To illustrate the <i>Masoretic</i> as contrasted with the
<i>unpointed</i> text, we give the first verse of Genesis,
<i>first</i>, in its simple unpointed form; <i>secondly</i>, with
the vowel-signs and diacritical marks for the consonants;
<i>thirdly</i>, with both these and the accents, the last being the
complete Masoretic text.</p>
<p>[Hebrew: br'shit br' 'lhim et hshmym vet h'rts]</p>
<p>[Hebrew: bere'shit bara' 'elohim et hashamayim veet
ha'arets]</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id=
"page179"></a>{179}</span>
<p>The round circle above the initial letter in the third line
refers to a marginal <i>note of the Masorah</i> indicating that it
is to be written <i>large</i>.</p>
<p>Respecting the origin and antiquity of the Hebrew points a warm
controversy existed in former times. Some maintained that they were
coeval with the language itself; others that they were first
introduced by Ezra after the Babylonish captivity. But their later
origin&mdash;somewhere between the sixth and tenth
centuries&mdash;is now generally conceded. It is further agreed
that their inventors were able scholars, thoroughly acquainted as
well with the genius and structure of the language as with the
traditional pronunciation of the synagogue; and that they have
given a faithful representation of this pronunciation, as it
existed in their day. Their judgment, therefore, though not
invested with any divine authority, is very valuable. "It
represents a tradition, it is true; but a tradition of the oldest
and most important character." Horne's Introduction, vol. 2, p. 15,
edition of 1860.</p>
<p>6. The deep reverence of the Jews for their sacred books
manifests itself in their numerous rules for the guidance of
copyists in the transcription of the rolls designed for use in the
synagogue service. They extend to every minute particular&mdash;the
quality of the ink and the parchment (which latter must always be
prepared by a Jew from the skin of a clean animal, and fastened by
strings made from the skins of clean animals); the number, length,
and breadth of the columns; the number of lines in each column, and
the number of words in each line. No word must be written till the
copyist has first inspected it in the example before him, and
pronounced it aloud; before writing the name of God he must wash
his pen; all redundance or defect of letters must be carefully
avoided: prose must not be written as verse, or verse as prose; and
when the copy has been completed, it must be examined for approval
or rejection within thirty days. Superstitious, and even
ridiculous, as these rules are, we have in them a satisfactory
assurance of the fidelity with which the sacred text has been
perpetuated. Though their date may be posterior to the age of the
Talmudists (between 200 and 500 after Christ), the spirit of
reverence for the divine word which they manifest goes far back
beyond this age. We see it, free from these later superstitious
observances, in the transactions recorded in the eighth chapter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id=
"page180"></a>{180}</span> Nehemiah, when Ezra opened the book of
the law in the sight of all the people, "and when he opened it, all
the people stood up." The early history of the sacred text is
confessedly involved in great obscurity; but in the profound
reverence with which the Jews have ever regarded it since the
captivity, we have satisfactory proof that it has come down to us,
in all essential particulars, as Ezra left it. Of the primitive
text before the days of Ezra and his associates we have but a few
brief notices in the historical books. But in the fidelity and
skill of Ezra, who was "a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which
the Lord God of Israel had given," as well as in the intelligence
and deep earnestness of the men associated with him, we have a
reasonable ground of assurance that the sacred books which have
come down to us through their hands contain, in all essential
particulars, the primitive text in a pure and uncorrupt form.</p>
<p>7. As to the <i>age</i> of Hebrew manuscripts, it is to be
noticed that not many have come down to us from an earlier century
than the twelfth. In this respect there is a striking difference
between them and the Greek and Latin manuscripts of the New
Testament, a few of which are as old as the fourth and fifth
centuries, and quite a number anterior to the tenth. The oldest
known Hebrew manuscript, on the contrary, is a Pentateuch roll on
leather, now at Odessa, which, if the subscription stating that it
was <i>corrected</i> in the year 580 can be relied on, belongs to
the sixth century. One of De Rossi's manuscripts is supposed to
belong to the eighth century, and there are a few of the ninth and
tenth, and several of the eleventh. Bishop Walton supposes that
after the Masoretic text was fully settled, the Jewish rulers
condemned, as profane and illegitimate, all the older manuscripts
not conformed to this: whence, after a few ages, the rejected
copies mostly perished. The existing Hebrew manuscripts give the
Masoretic text with but little variation from each other.</p>
<p>Earnest effort has been made to find a reliable ante-Masoretic
text, but to no purpose. The search in China has thus far been
fruitless. When <span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id=
"page181"></a>{181}</span> Dr. Buchanan in 1806 brought from India
a synagogue-roll which he found among the Jews of Malabar, high
expectations were raised. But it is now conceded to be a Masoretic
roll, probably of European origin. Respecting the manuscripts of
the <i>Samaritan</i> Pentateuch, see below, No. 9.</p>
<p>(A synagogue-roll has recently been discovered in the Crimea of
the date answering to A.D. 489. See Alexander's Kitto, vol. 3, pp.
1172-5.)</p>
<p>8. In respect to <i>form</i>, Hebrew manuscripts fall into two
great divisions, <i>public</i> and <i>private</i>. The public
manuscripts consist of <i>synagogue-rolls</i> carefully written out
on parchment, as already described, without vowel-points or
divisions of verses. The Law is written on a single roll; the
sections from the prophets (Haphtaroth, ch. 12. 6) and the Five
Rolls&mdash;Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther
(ch. 12. 4)&mdash;each on separate rolls. The private manuscripts
are written <i>with leaves</i> in book form&mdash;folio, quarto,
octavo, and duodecimo; mostly on parchment, but some of the later
on paper. The poetical passages are generally arranged in
hemistichs; the rest is in columns which vary according to the size
of the page. The text and points were always written separately;
the former with a heavier, the latter with a lighter pen, and
generally with different ink. The square or Assyrian character is
employed as a rule, but a few are written in the rabbinic
character. The Chaldee paraphrase (less frequently some other
version) may be added. The margin contains more or less of the
Masorah; sometimes prayers, psalms, rabbinical commentaries,
etc.</p>
<p>9. There is also a <i>Samaritan Pentateuch</i>; that is, a
Hebrew Pentateuch written in the ancient Samaritan characters, and
first brought to light in 1616, respecting the origin of which very
different opinions are held. Some suppose that the Samaritans
received it as an inheritance from the ten tribes; others that it
was introduced at the time of the founding of the Samaritan temple
on Mount Gerizim; others that it was brought by the Israelitish
priest sent to instruct the Samaritans in the knowledge of God, 2
Kings 17:27, 28. It is agreed among biblical scholars that its text
has been subjected to many alterations which greatly impair its
critical authority. These, however, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page182" id="page182"></a>{182}</span> are not sufficient to
account for its remarkable agreement with the Septuagint version
against the Masoretic text, in numerous readings, some of them of
importance. The explanation of this phenomenon must be the
agreement of the original Samaritan codex with the manuscripts from
which the Alexandrine version was executed. Probably both were of
Egyptian origin. See Alexander's Kitto, art. Samaritan
Pentateuch.</p>
<p>In a brief compend, like the present work, it is not thought
necessary to notice particularly the <i>printed</i> editions of the
Hebrew Bible. The reader will find an account of them in the
"Bibliographical List" appended to the fourth volume of Horne's
Introduction, edition of 1860. The text of Van der Hooght's Hebrew
Bible, (Amsterdam and Utrecht, 1705,) which was chiefly based on
the earlier text of Athias, (Amsterdam, 1667,) is generally
followed at the present day, and may be regarded as the received
text of the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>FORMATION AND HISTORY OF THE HEBREW CANON.</h3>
<p>1. The Greek word <i>canon</i> (originally a <i>straight rod or
pole</i>, <i>measuring-rod</i>, then <i>rule</i>) denotes that
collection of books which the churches receive as given by
inspiration of God, and therefore as constituting for them a divine
rule of faith and practice. To the books included in it the term
<i>canonical</i> is applied. The Canon of the Old Testament,
considered in reference to its constituent parts, was formed
gradually; formed under divine superintendence by a process of
growth extending through many centuries. The history of its
formation may be conveniently considered under the following
divisions: (1,) the <i>Pentateuch</i>; (2,) the <i>historical</i>
books; (3,) the <i>prophetical</i> books in the stricter sense of
the term; (4,) a somewhat miscellaneous collection of books which
may be designated in a general way as <i>poetical</i>.</p>
<h3>I. THE PENTATEUCH.</h3>
<p>2. In the name applied to the Pentateuch&mdash;"the book of the
law," and more fully, "the book of the law of Moses," "the book of
the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel"&mdash;we
have from the beginning the general idea of the canon. A canonical
writing is one that contains a communication from God to men, and
has therefore the impress of divine authority. In its outward form
it may be preceptive, historical, or meditative. But in all these
different modes it still reveals to men God's character, and the
duties which he requires of them. The Hebrews never admitted to the
number of their sacred books a writing that was secular in its
character. Even those who deny the canonical authority of certain
parts of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id=
"page184"></a>{184}</span> Old Testament acknowledge that the Jews
received these parts because they believed them to be of a sacred
character.</p>
<p>3. In Deut. 31:9-13, 24-26; 17:18, 19, we read: "And Moses wrote
this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which
bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders
of Israel. And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every
seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
of tabernacles, when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord
thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this
law before all Israel in their hearing. Gather the people together,
men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy
gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the
Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: and
that their children which have not known anything, may hear, and
learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land
whither ye go over Jordan to possess it:" "and it came to pass,
when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a
book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites,
which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this
book of the law, and put it in the side" (that is, not
<i>within</i>, but <i>by the side</i>. Compare Josh. 12:9; Ruth
2:14; 1 Sam. 20:25; Psa. 91:7; where the same word is used in the
original) "of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it
may be there for a witness against thee;" "and it shall be when
he"&mdash;the king whom the Israelites in some future age shall set
over themselves&mdash;"sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that
he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which
is before the priests the Levites: and it shall be with him, and he
shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to
fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law and the
statutes, to do them." These passages are of the weightiest import;
for they teach us how the <i>nucleus</i> of the canon of the Old
Testament was formed, and give us all the particulars that enter
into the idea of a canonical writing. It is given by God as an
authoritative rule of faith <span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"
id="page185"></a>{185}</span> and practice; it is committed to the
custody of his people through their recognized officers, and that
for all future time; it is to be published to the people at large,
and diligently studied by the rulers, that they and the people
together may know and do the will of God. It is not necessary to
decide the question how much is included in the words "this book of
the law," Deut. 31:26, whether the whole Pentateuch, or only the
book of Deuteronomy. The arguments to show that the four preceding
books came, in all essential respects, from the pen of Moses have
been already given (Ch. 9, Nos. 7-9), and need not be here
repeated. We only add that even if the reference is to Deuteronomy
alone, as some suppose, the rule for this book would naturally be
the rule for all the previous writings. They also would be laid up
by the side of the ark; for it is plain that the priests and
Levites, who had charge of the sanctuary, were made the keepers of
the sacred writings generally.</p>
<p>As a matter of simple convenience the book of Deuteronomy was
written on a separate roll ("in a book," Deut. 31:24). But if this
book, when finished, was laid up with the earlier portions of the
law at the side of the ark, so as to constitute with them a single
collection, and if, as we may reasonably suppose, Moses, in writing
the book of Deuteronomy, contemplated such a collection of all the
parts of the law into one whole; then, when the law is mentioned,
whether in Deuteronomy or in the later books, we are to understand
the whole law, unless there be something in the context to limit
its meaning, as there is, for example, in Joshua 8:32 compared with
Deut. 27:1-8. The command to "read this law before all Israel in
their hearing," "at the end of every seven years, in the solemnity
of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles," was
understood in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah of the whole law, and
not of Deuteronomy alone (Ch. 9, No. 4); and so Josephus plainly
understood it: "But when the multitude is assembled in the holy
city at the septennial sacrifices on the occasion of the feast of
tabernacles, let the high priest, standing on a lofty stage whence
he can be plainly heard, read the laws to all." Antiq. 4.8, 12.
"The laws," in the usage of Josephus, naturally mean the whole
collection of laws.</p>
<h3>II. THE HISTORICAL BOOKS.</h3>
<p>4. The history of these is involved in obscurity. In respect to
most of them we know not the authors, nor the exact date of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id=
"page186"></a>{186}</span> their composition. There are, however,
two notices that shed much light on the general history of the
earlier historical books. In the last chapter of the book of
Joshua, after an account of the renewal of the covenant at Shechem,
it is added: "And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law
of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak
that was by the sanctuary of the Lord." Josh. 24:26. Again, upon
the occasion of the establishment of the kingdom under Saul, we are
told that "Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord." 1 Sam. 10:25.
From the first of these passages we learn that a theocratic man
after Moses, who had the spirit of prophecy, connected his writings
(or at least one portion of them) with the law. This addition by
Joshua, though never formally regarded as a part of the law,
virtually belonged to it, since it contained a renewal of the
covenant between God and his people. From the second passage we
learn that the place for other important documents pertaining to
the theocracy was "before the Lord," where the law was deposited.
Hence we infer with much probability that, besides the addition
made to "the book of the law of God," important historical
writings, proceeding from prophetical men, like Joshua and Samuel,
were in process of collection at the sanctuary all the time from
Moses to Samuel.</p>
<p>5. If now we examine the books of Joshua and Judges, we must be
satisfied that the men who compiled them made use of such
materials. In the book of Joshua is recorded, with much detail, the
allotment of the land of Canaan among the several tribes. A
document of this nature must have been written at the time, and by
Joshua himself, or under his immediate direction. The same may be
reasonably supposed of other portions of the book. If then it was
put into its present form after the death of Joshua, as some
suppose, the materials must still have been furnished by him to a
great extent. The book of Judges covers a period of more than three
centuries. Who composed it we do not know, but the materials
employed by him must <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id=
"page187"></a>{187}</span> have existed, in part at least, in a
written form. The book of Ruth may be regarded as an appendix to
that of the Judges.</p>
<p>6. The two books of Samuel (which originally constituted one
whole) bring down the history of the Theocracy from the birth of
Samuel to the close of David's reign&mdash;a period of about a
century and a half. The author, therefore, can have been, upon any
supposition, only in part contemporary with the events which he
records. Yet if we examine the biographical sketches of Saul,
Samuel, and David contained in these books, the conviction forces
itself upon us that they must have been written by contemporaries.
Their freshness, minute accuracy of detail, and graphic vividness
of style mark them as coming from eye-witnesses, or from writers
who had received their accounts from eye-witnesses. Who were
authors of these original documents we cannot determine. It is
certain that Samuel was one of them. 1 Chron. 29:29. Who composed
the books, again, is a question that we are unable to answer. It
was probably a prophet living not very long after the separation of
the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. From the days of Samuel and
onward there was a flourishing school of the prophets at hand which
could furnish, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, both the
writers of the original materials and the author of the books in
their present form.</p>
<p>The attempt has been made to set aside the evidence that the
writer of the books of Samuel made use of earlier documents, from
the example of such men as Swift and Defoe, who composed works of
fiction with all the simplicity and circumstantial detail of those
who write authentic history as eye-witnesses. But, unless the
design be to class the books of Samuel with "Gulliver's Travels"
and "Robinson Crusoe," the argument is wholly irrelevant. With
Swift and Defoe simplicity and minuteness of detail were a matter
of conscious effort&mdash;<i>a work of art</i>, for which they
naturally chose the region of fiction; and here they, and other men
of genius, have been eminently successful. Shakespeare has
portrayed <i>ideal</i> scenes in the life of Julius C&aelig;sar
with more vividness and circumstantiality than any authentic
historian of C&aelig;sar's age. But <i>real history</i>, written
simply in the interest of truth, never has the graphic character,
artless simplicity, and circumstantiality of detail which belong to
these inimitable narratives, unless the writer be either an
eye-witness, or draw his materials from eye-witnesses.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id=
"page188"></a>{188}</span>
<p>7. We come next to the books of Kings and Chronicles, the
writers of which confessedly employed previously existing
materials. In the two books of Kings (which, like the two of Samuel
and of Chronicles, originally constituted one work) reference is
made to the following sources: For the reign of Solomon, "the book
of the acts of Solomon" (1 Kings 11:41); for the kingdom of Judah
after the revolt of the twelve tribes from Rehoboam to Jehoiakim,
"the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah;" for the kingdom
of Israel, "the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel." In
the books of Chronicles we have: For the reign of David, "the book"
(history) "of Samuel the seer, the book of Nathan the prophet, and
the book of Gad the seer" (1 Chron. 29:29); for the reign of
Solomon, "the book of Nathan the prophet, the prophecy of Ahijah
the Shilonite," and "the vision of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam
the son of Nebat" (2 Chron. 9:29); for the reign of Rehoboam, "the
book of Shemaiah the prophet," and "of Iddo the seer concerning
genealogies," that is, in the manner of a genealogical record (2
Chron. 12:15); for the reign of Abijah, "the story" (commentary)
"of the prophet Iddo" (2 Chron. 13:22); for the reign of
Jehoshaphat, "the book of Jehu the son of Hanani," who is mentioned
(rather, <i>who is inserted</i>, i.e., as an author) in the book of
the kings of Israel (2 Chron. 20:34); for the reign of Uzziah, "the
prophet Isaiah" (2 Chron. 26:22); for the reign of Hezekiah in
part, "the vision of Isaiah the prophet" (2 Chron. 32:32); for the
reign of Manasseh in part, "the sayings of the seers," or, as many
prefer to render, "the words of Hosai" (2 Chron. 33:18). Besides
the above, reference is made to "the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel," "the book of the kings of Israel and Judah," "the story of
the book of the kings;" "the book of the kings of Israel." These
last are probably only different titles of the same collection of
annals, embracing in its contents the history of <i>both</i>
kingdoms; since the references to the book of the kings of Israel
are for the affairs of the kingdom of Judah (2 Chron. 20:34;
33:18).</p>
<p>8. With regard to the above <i>original sources</i>, it should
be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id=
"page189"></a>{189}</span> carefully noticed that the references in
the books of Kings are not to our present books of Chronicles,
which did not exist when the books of Kings were written. Chap. 20,
No. 21. Neither can the allusions in the books of Chronicles be
restricted to our present books of Kings; for (1) they refer to
matters not recorded in those books&mdash;for example, to the wars
of Jotham, 2 Chron. 27:7; (2) they refer to the book of the kings
of Judah and Israel for a <i>full</i> account of the acts of a
given monarch "first and last," while the history of the same
monarch in our present books of Kings refers for <i>further</i>
information to the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah. It
is plain that both writers had access to a <i>larger collection of
original documents</i>, which were in great part the same. The
chief difference in outward form is that, when the books of
Chronicles were written, the annals of the two kingdoms of Judah
and Israel seem to have constituted a single collection, whereas in
the books of Kings they are always mentioned as two separate works.
In making his selections from these annals, each writer proceeded
independently. Hence the remarkable agreements, where both used the
same materials; and the remarkable differences, where one employed
documents, or parts of documents, which the other omitted to
use.</p>
<p>9. As to the <i>character</i> of these original documents, it is
plain that a portion of them were written by prophets. By some the
books of the kings of Israel and Judah so often referred to, have
been regarded as simply the public annals of the two kingdoms
written by the official annalists, the "scribes" or "recorders" so
often spoken of. No doubt such annals existed, and entered largely
into the documents in question. But the right interpretation of 2
Chron. 20:34, shows that, in some cases at least, the writings of
prophets were incorporated into these annals. The extended history
of Elijah and Elisha cannot have been the work of the public
scribes of the kingdom of Israel, but of prophets, writing from the
prophetic point of view. The question, however, is not one of
practical importance, since, whatever may have been the source or
character <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id=
"page190"></a>{190}</span> of the materials employed, the writers
of the books now under consideration, used them at their discretion
under the guidance of the Spirit of God. To us, therefore, they
come with the weight of prophetic authority. The further
consideration of the relation between the books of Kings and
Chronicles is reserved for the special introductions to these
books. It may be added here that the probable date of the former is
the first half of the Babylonish captivity; of the latter, the time
of Ezra under the Persian rule.</p>
<p>10. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah constitute a continuation of
the books of Chronicles, and need not be particularly noticed in
the present connection. For their authorship and date, as also for
the book of Esther, see the particular introductions to these
books.</p>
<h3>III. THE PROPHETICAL BOOKS.</h3>
<p>11. Under the <i>prophetical books</i>, in the stricter sense of
the word, may be included the three Greater prophets&mdash;Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and Ezekiel&mdash;Daniel (though largely historical), and
the twelve Minor prophets. These will all come up hereafter for
separate consideration. At present we view them simply with
reference to the growth of the Old Testament Canon. From the
settlement of the Israelities in the land of Canaan to the time of
Samuel, a period of several centuries (according to the chronology
followed by the apostle Paul, Acts 13:20, four hundred and fifty
years), we read of several appearances of the "angel of the Lord."
Judges 2:1; 6:11; 13:3. The notices of prophets during the same
period are only three in number. Judges 4:4; 6:8; 1 Sam. 2:27. But
with Samuel began a new era. He was himself one of the greatest of
the prophets, and he established a school of the prophets over
which he himself presided. 1 Sam. 10:5, 10; 19:20. From his day
onward such schools seem to have flourished as a theocratic
institution throughout the whole period of the kings, though more
vigorously at certain times. 1 Kings 18:4; 20:35; 2 Kings 2:3, 5;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id=
"page191"></a>{191}</span> 4:1, 38, 43; 5:22; 6:1; 9:1. So far as
we have notices of these schools, they were under the instruction
of eminent prophets; and "the sons of the prophets" assembled in
them received such a training as fitted them, so far as human
instrumentality is concerned, for the exercise of the prophetical
office, as well as for being, in a more general sense, the
religious instructors of the people. From these schools came,
apparently, most of those whom God called to be his messengers to
the rulers and people, though with exceptions according to his
sovereign wisdom. Amos 1:1; 7:14. We find, accordingly, that from
the days of Samuel and onward the prophets were recognized as a
<i>distinct order of men</i> in the Jewish theocracy, who derived
their authority immediately from God, and spoke by direct
inspiration of his Spirit, as they themselves indicate by the
standing formula: "Thus saith the Lord."</p>
<p>12. It is a remarkable fact, however, that from Samuel to about
the reign of Uzziah, a period of some three centuries, we have no
<i>books of prophecy</i> written by these men, if we except,
perhaps, the book of Jonah. Their writings seem to have been mainly
historical (like the historical notices incorporated into the books
of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel); and what remains to us
of them is preserved in the historical books of the Old Testament.
See above, Nos. 6 and 7. But about the time of Uzziah begins a new
era, that of <i>written</i> prophecy. During his reign appeared
Hosea, Amos, Isaiah, and probably Jonah, Joel, and Obadiah. Micah
followed immediately afterwards, being contemporary in part with
Isaiah; and then, in succession, the rest of the prophets whose
writings have come down to us. When the theocracy was now on its
decline, waxing old and destined to pass away for ever, they felt
themselves called to <i>put on record</i>, for the instruction of
all coming ages, their words of warning and encouragement. Thus
arose gradually our present collection of prophetical books; that
of Lamentations included, which is but an appendix to the writings
of Jeremiah.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id=
"page192"></a>{192}</span>
<h3>IV. THE POETICAL BOOKS.</h3>
<p>13. These are a precious outgrowth of the theocratic spirit, in
which the elements of <i>meditation and reflection</i> predominate.
Concerning the date and authorship of the book of Job, which stands
first in order in our arrangement, we have no certain information.
Learned men vary between the ante-Mosaic age and that of Solomon.
Its theme is divine providence, as viewed from the position of the
Old Testament. See further in the introduction to this book.</p>
<p>14. With the call of David to the throne of Israel began a new
and glorious era in the history of public worship, that of "the
service of song in the house of the Lord." 1 Chron. 6:31. As when
Moses smote the rock in the wilderness the water gushed forth in
refreshing streams, so the soul of David, touched by the spirit of
inspiration, poured forth a rich and copious flood of divine song,
which has in all ages refreshed and strengthened God's people in
their journey heavenward "through this dark vale of tears." Nor was
the fountain of sacred poetry confined to him alone. God opened it
also in the souls of such men as Asaph, Ethan, Heman, and the sons
of Korah; nor did its flow wholly cease till after the captivity.
The Psalms of David and his coadjutors were from the first
dedicated to the service of the sanctuary; and thus arose our
canonical book of Psalms, although (as will be hereafter shown) it
did not receive its present form and arrangement till the time of
Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>
<p>15. After David came Solomon in the sphere of practical wisdom.
This, according to the divine record, he received as a special
endowment from God, though doubtless he had in a peculiar measure a
natural capacity for such an endowment. In Gibeon the Lord appeared
to him in a dream by night, and said: "Ask what I shall give thee."
Passing by wealth, long life, and the death of his enemies, the
youthful monarch besought God to give him "an understanding heart,"
that he might be qualified to judge the great people committed to
his care. The answer was: "Behold, I have done according to thy
word: <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id=
"page193"></a>{193}</span> lo, I have given thee a wise and an
understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,
neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee." 1 Kings 3:5-12.
Thus divinely qualified, he embodied, in a vast collection of
proverbs, his observations on human life, and the course of human
affairs. Our canonical book of Proverbs is a selection from these,
with some additions at the end from other sources. For notices
respecting the arrangement of these proverbs in their present form,
as well as respecting the books of Ecclesiastes and Canticles,
which are also ascribed to Solomon, the reader may consult the
introductions to these books.</p>
<h3>V. THE COMPLETION OF THE CANON.</h3>
<p>The subject thus far before us has been <i>the growth of the
materials</i> which constitute our canonical books. The question of
their preservation and final embodiment in their present form
remains to be considered.</p>
<p>16. Respecting the <i>preservation</i> of the sacred books till
the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, our information is very scanty. Each
king was required to have at hand for his own personal use a
transcript of the law of Moses (Deut. 17:18), the original writing
being carefully laid up in the inner sanctuary, where Hilkiah, the
high priest, found it in the reign of Josiah. 2 Kings 22:8. We
cannot doubt that such kings as David, Solomon, Asa, and Hezekiah
complied with this law: though after the disorders connected with
the reign of Manasseh and his captivity, the good king Josiah
neglected it. Jehoshaphat, we are expressly told, sent men to teach
in the cities of Judah, who had "the book of the law of the Lord
with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and
taught the people." 2 Chron. 17:7-9. Of course it was a copy, and
not the original autograph, which might not be removed from the
sanctuary. It is a natural supposition that other transcripts of
the law were made under the direction of the high priest, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id=
"page194"></a>{194}</span> the use of pious men, especially pious
prophets, princes, and Levites, who needed its directions for the
right discharge of their official duties, though on this point we
can affirm nothing positively. As to the prophetical books, we know
that Jeremiah had access to the writings of Isaiah, for in repeated
instances he borrowed his language. We know again that Daniel had
at hand the prophecies of Jeremiah; for he understood "by books"
(literally "by the books," which may be well understood to mean
that collection of sacred books of which the prophecies of Jeremiah
formed a part) "the number of the years whereof the word of the
Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy
years in the desolations of Jerusalem." Dan. 9:2. The consecration
of the Psalms of David and his coadjutors to the public service of
the sanctuary must have insured their careful preservation by the
Levites who had charge of the temple music; and, in general, the
deep reverence of the Jews for their sacred writings is to us a
reasonable evidence that they preserved them from loss and
mutilation to the captivity, and through that calamitous
period.</p>
<p>17. To Ezra and his coadjutors, the men of the Great Synagogue,
the Jews ascribe the <i>completion of the canon</i> of the Old
Testament. Their traditions concerning him are embellished with
extravagant fictions; yet we cannot reasonably deny that they are
underlaid by a basis of truth. All the scriptural notices of Ezra
attest both his zeal and his ability as "a scribe of the words of
the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel," a man
who "had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do
it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments." Ezra 7:10, 11.
The work in which he and his associates were engaged was the
re&euml;stablishment of the Theocracy on its old foundation, the
law of Moses, with the ordinances pertaining to the
sanctuary-service afterwards added by David; and that too in the
vivid consciousness of the fact that disobedience to the divine law
had brought upon the nation the calamities of the captivity. In
such circumstances their first <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page195" id="page195"></a>{195}</span> solicitude must have been
that the people might have the inspired oracles given to their
fathers, and be thoroughly instructed in them. The work, therefore,
which Jewish tradition ascribes to Ezra and the men of the Great
Synagogue was altogether appropriate to their situation, nor do we
know of any man or body of men afterwards so well qualified for its
performance, or upon whom it would so naturally have devolved.</p>
<p>That they arranged the inspired volume in substantially its
present form, we have no good reason for doubting. But we should
not, perhaps, be warranted in saying that they brought the canon of
the Old Testament absolutely and formally to a close. Josephus
(against Apion 1. 8) affirms that no book belongs to the sacred
writings of his nation "which are justly believed to be divine,"
that had its origin after the reign of Artaxerxes, Xerxes' son
(Artaxerxes Longimanus, under whom Ezra led forth his colony, Ezra,
chap. 7); and that on the ground that from this time onward "the
exact succession of the prophets" was wanting. This declaration of
the Jewish historian is in all essential respects worthy of full
credence. We cannot, however, affirm with confidence that all the
later historical books were put by Ezra and his contemporaries into
the exact form in which we now have them. The book of Nehemiah, for
example, contains some genealogical notices (chap. 12:11, 22)
which, according to any fair interpretation, are of a later date.
We are at liberty to suppose that these were afterwards added
officially and in good faith, as matters of public interest; or, as
some think, that the book itself is an arrangement by a later hand
of writings left by Nehemiah, perhaps also by Ezra; so that while
its contents belong, in every essential respect, to them, it
received its present form after their death. Respecting the
question when the canon of the Old Testament received its finishing
stroke, a question which the wisdom of God has left in obscurity,
we must speak with diffidence. We know with certainty that our
present Hebrew canon is identical with that collection of sacred
writings to which our Saviour and his apostles constantly appealed
as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id=
"page196"></a>{196}</span> invested throughout with divine
authority, and this is a firm basis for our faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attempt has been made, but without success, to show that a
portion of the Psalms belongs to the Maccabean age. The words of
the Psalmist (Psa. 74:8) rendered in our version: "They have burned
up all the synagogues of God in the land," have no reference to the
synagogues of a later age, as is now generally admitted. The Hebrew
word denotes <i>places of assembly</i>, and was never applied by
the later Jews to their synagogues. The Psalmist wrote, moreover,
in immediate connection with the burning of the temple&mdash;"they
have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting
down the dwelling-place of thy name to the ground"&mdash;and this
fixes the date of the Psalm to the Chaldean invasion (2 Kings
25:9); for the temple was not burned, but only profaned, in the
days of the Maccabees. By "the assemblies of God," we are probably
to understand the ancient sacred places, such as Ramah, Bethel, and
Gilgal, where the people were accustomed to meet, though in a
somewhat irregular way, for the worship of God. But whether this
interpretation be correct or not, the words have no reference to
the buildings of a later age called synagogues.</p>
<p>Some of the apocryphal writings, as, for example, the book of
Wisdom, the book of Ecclesiasticus, the first book of Maccabees,
were highly valued by the ancient Jews. But they were never
received into the Hebrew canon, because their authors lived
<i>after</i> "the exact succession of the prophets," which ended
with Malachi. They knew how to make the just distinction between
books of human wisdom and books written "by inspiration of
God."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>18. The earliest notice of the <i>contents of the Hebrew
Canon</i> is that contained in the prologue to the Greek
translation of Ecclesiasticus, where it is described as "the law,
the prophets, and the other national books," "the law, and the
prophecies, and the rest of the books," according to the three-fold
division already considered. Chap. 18, No. 4. Josephus, in the
passage already referred to (against Apion, 1. 8), says: "We have
not among us innumerable books discordant and contrary to each
other, but only two-and-twenty, containing the history of all time,
which are justly believed to be divine. And of these five belong to
Moses, which contain the laws and the transmission of human
genealogy to the time of his death. This period of time wants but
little of three thousand years" (the longer chronology followed by
him). "But from the death of Moses <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page197" id="page197"></a>{197}</span> to the reign of Artaxerxes,
who was king of the Persians after Xerxes, the prophets after Moses
wrote the history of their times in thirteen books. The remaining
four contain hymns to God and precepts for human life. From
Artaxerxes to our time various books have been written; but they
have not been esteemed worthy of credence like that given to the
books before them, because the exact succession of the prophets has
been wanting." In this list the books of the Old Testament are
artificially arranged to agree with the number
<i>two-and-twenty</i>, that of the Hebrew alphabet. The four that
contain "hymns to God and precepts for human life" are, in all
probability: Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles; and the
thirteen prophetical books (see below) are: (1) Joshua, (2) Judges
and Ruth, (3) the two books of Samuel, (4) the two books of Kings,
(5) the two books of Chronicles, (6) Ezra and Nehemiah, (7) Esther,
(8) Isaiah, (9) Jeremiah and Lamentations, (10) Ezekiel, (11)
Daniel, (12) the book of the twelve Minor Prophets, (13) Job. See
Oehler in Hertzog's Encyclop&aelig;dia, Art. Canon of the Old
Testament. Origen, as quoted by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl. 6.25), and
Jerome (both of whom drew their information concerning the Hebrew
Canon immediately from Jewish scholars, and may, therefore, be
regarded as in a certain sense the expositors of the above list of
Josephus) make mention of the same number, twenty-two. Origen's
list unites Ruth with Judges, puts together the first and second of
Samuel, the first and second of Kings, the first and second of
Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah (under the names of the first and
second of Ezra), and Jeremiah and Lamentations (with the addition
of the apocryphal Epistle of Jeremiah&mdash;an inconsistency, or
rather oversight, to be explained from his constant habit of using
the Septuagint version). In the present text of Eusebius, the book
of the twelve Minor Prophets is wanting. But this is simply an old
error of the scribe, since it is necessary to complete the number
of twenty-two. Jerome's list (Prologus galeatus) is the same, only
that he gives the contents of the Law, the Prophets, and the
Hagiographa in accordance with the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page198" id="page198"></a>{198}</span> Hebrew arrangement, placing
Daniel in the last class, and adding that whatever is without the
number of these must be placed among the Apocryphal writings.
Smith's Dict. of the Bible, Art. Canon. The catalogue of these two
distinguished Christian scholars&mdash;Origen of the Eastern
church, and Jerome of the Western, both of whom drew their
information immediately from Hebrew scholars&mdash;is decisive, and
we need add nothing further.</p>
<p>19. The <i>Apocryphal books</i> of the Old Testament were
incorporated into the Alexandrine version called the Septuagint;
but they were never received by the Jews of Palestine as a part of
the sacred volume. Concerning them and their history, see further
in the Appendix to this part.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>ANCIENT VERSIONS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>In the present chapter only those versions of the Old Testament
are noticed which were made independently of the New. Versions of
the whole Bible, made in the interest of Christianity, are
considered in the following part.</p>
<h3>I. THE GREEK VERSION CALLED THE SEPTUAGINT.</h3>
<p>1. This is worthy of special notice as the oldest existing
version of the holy Scriptures, or any part of them, in any
language; and also as the version which exerted a very large
influence on the language and style of the New Testament; for it
was extensively used in our Lord's day not only in Egypt, where it
originated, and in the Roman provinces generally, but also in
Palestine; and the quotations in the New Testament are made more
commonly from it than from the Hebrew.</p>
<p>2. The Jewish account of its origin, first noticed briefly by
Aristobulus, a Jew (as quoted by Clement of Alexandria and
Eusebius), then given at great length in a letter which professes
to have been written by one Aristeas, a heathen and a special
friend of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and the main part of
which Josephus has copied (Antiq. 12. 2), is for substance as
follows: Ptolemy Philadelphus (who reigned from B.C. 285 to 247),
at the suggestion of his librarian Demetrius Phalereus, after
having first liberated all the Jewish captives found in his
kingdom, sent an embassy with costly gifts to Eleazar the high
priest at Jerusalem, requesting that he would send him chosen men,
six from each of the twelve tribes, with a copy of the Jewish law,
that it might be interpreted from the Hebrew into the Greek and
laid up in the royal library at Alexandria. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>{200}</span> Eleazar
accordingly sent the seventy-two elders with a copy of the laws
written on parchments in letters of gold, who were received by the
king with high honors, sumptuously feasted, and afterwards lodged
in a palace on an island (apparently Pharos in the harbor of
Alexandria), where they completed their work in seventy-two days,
and were then sent home with munificent gifts. The story that they
were shut up in seventy-two separate cells (according to another
legend two by two in thirty-six cells), where they had no
communication with each other and yet produced as many versions
agreeing with each other word for word, was a later embellishment
designed (as indeed were all the legends respecting the origin of
this version) to exalt its character in the apprehension of the
people, and to gain for it an authority equal to that of the
inspired original.</p>
<p>3. The letter ascribed to Aristeas is now generally admitted to
be spurious. It purports to have been written by a heathen scholar,
yet it bears throughout marks of a Jewish origin. It represents the
translators as Jewish elders sent by the high priest from
Jerusalem. Yet the version is acknowledged to be in the Alexandrine
Greek dialect. For these and other reasons learned men ascribe its
authorship to a Jew whose object was to exalt the merits of the
Alexandrine version in the estimation of his nation. But we are
not, for this reason, warranted to pronounce the whole account a
pure fable, as many have done. We may well believe that the work
was executed under the auspices of Ptolemy, and for the purpose of
enriching his library. But we must believe that it was executed by
Jews born in Egypt to whom the Greek language was vernacular, and
probably from manuscripts of Egyptian origin. Thus much is manifest
from the face of the version, that it was made by different men,
and with different degrees of ability and fidelity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name <i>Septuagint</i> (Latin, <i>Septuaginta</i>),
<i>seventy</i>, a round number for the more exact
<i>seventy-two</i>, probably arose from this tradition of the
execution of the work by seventy-two elders in seventy-two days.
The story <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id=
"page201"></a>{201}</span> of the parchments sent from Jerusalem
for the use of the translators (with the request that they might be
returned with them) has been rejected on the ground that the text
used by them differs too widely from the Palestinian text. See
further on this subject in No. 5, below. It has been further
affirmed that Demetrius Phalereus did not belong to the reign of
Ptolemy Philadelphus, but to that of his father Ptolemy Soter, the
son having banished him from court in the beginning of his reign.
For this reason some have proposed to assign the founding of the
Alexandrian library to the father and not the son. But whatever be
our judgment in respect to Demetrius and his relation to the two
Ptolemies, the voice of history is decisive in favor of the son and
not the father, as the patron of learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. It has been a question whether the Hebrew Scriptures were
translated at one time, or in successive portions. The tradition
above considered speaks only of <i>the law</i>, or, in the plural,
<i>the laws</i>. These might, perhaps, be understood as
comprehensive terms for the whole Old Testament, but they probably
mean the Pentateuch alone, in which both the Egyptian king and the
Jews of his realm would feel a special interest. It is probable
that the Pentateuch&mdash;the <i>Law</i> in the proper sense of the
term&mdash;was first translated, and afterwards the remaining
books. But how long a period of time was thus occupied cannot be
determined. Respecting the incorporation into this version of the
apocryphal book, see in the appendix to this Part, No. 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the translator of the Wisdom of Jesus, son of Sirach
(Ecclesiasticus), says in his prologue, in immediate connection
with his residence and labors in Egypt, that "the law itself and
the prophets, and the rest of the books have no small difference
[as to force] when read in their own tongue," he plainly refers to
the Septuagint version as complete in his day. He visited Egypt
"under Euergetes." But to which of the two monarchs who bore that
title he refers is uncertain. If to the former, it was between
246-221 B.C.; if to the latter, between 145-116 B.C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. The version varies so much in its different parts that it is
not easy to give its character as a whole. It is agreed among
biblical scholars that the translators of the Pentateuch excelled
in ability and fidelity, according to the well-known judgment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id=
"page202"></a>{202}</span> Jerome&mdash;"which [the books of Moses]
we also acknowledge to agree more than the others with the Hebrew."
Among the historical books the translations of Samuel and Kings are
the most faulty. Those of the prophets are in general poor,
especially that of Isaiah. That of Daniel was so faulty that the
Christians in later times substituted for it the translation of
Theodotion. See below, No. 10. Among the poetical books that of
Proverbs is the best. As a whole the Septuagint version cannot for
a moment enter into competition with the Hebrew original. Yet, as
the most ancient of versions and one which also represents a text
much older than the Masoretic, its use is indispensable to every
scholar who would study the Old Testament in the original
language.</p>
<p>6. Independently of its critical value, the Septuagint must be
regarded with deep interest from its close connection with the New
Testament. In the days of Christ and his apostles it was known and
read throughout the whole Roman empire by the Hellenists; that is,
by those Jews and Jewish proselytes who had the Greek civilization
and spoke the Greek language. As the Alexandrine Greek, in which
this version was made, was itself pervaded throughout with the
Hebrew spirit, and to a great extent also with Hebrew idioms and
forms of thought, so was the language of the New Testament, in
turn, moulded and shaped by the dialect of the Septuagint, nor can
the former be successfully studied except in connection with the
latter. Then again the greatest number of quotations in the New
Testament from the Old is made from the Septuagint. According to
Mr. Greenfield (quoted in Smith's Bible Dict., art. Septuagint)
"the number of direct quotations from the Old Testament in the
Gospels, Acts, and Epistles, may be estimated at three hundred and
fifty, of which not more than fifty materially differ from the
seventy. But the indirect verbal allusions would swell the number
to a far greater amount." The discussion of the principles upon
which the writers of the New Testament quote from the Old belongs
to another part of this work. It may be briefly remarked here that
they quote in a free spirit, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> not in that of servile
adherence to the letter, aiming to give the substance of the sacred
writers' thoughts, rather than an exactly literal rendering of the
original word for word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prophecy of Isaiah, for example (6:9, 10), is six times
quoted in the New Testament, wholly or in part, with very free
variations of language. Matt. 13:14, 15; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; John
12:40; Acts 28: 26, 27; Rom. 11:8. From neither of these
quotations, nor from all of them combined, could we draw a
<i>critical</i> argument respecting either the Hebrew or Greek text
of the passage quoted. Neither can we argue from the exact
agreement of a quotation in the New Testament with the Septuagint
where that differs from the Hebrew, that the Hebrew text has been
corrupted. The New Testament writers are occupied with the spirit
of the passages to which they refer, rather than with the
letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. The Hebrew <i>text</i> from which the Septuagint version was
executed was unpointed and much older than the Masoretic text. Were
the version more literal and faithful, and had its text come down
to us in a purer form (see below, Chap. 17, No. 2), it would be of
great service in settling the exact text of the original Hebrew.
With its present character, and in the present condition of its
text, it is of but comparatively small value in this respect. Yet
its striking agreement with the text of the Samaritan Pentateuch
(Ch. 13, No. 8) is a phenomenon worthy of special notice. Biblical
scholars affirm that the two agree in more than a thousand places
where they differ from the Hebrew. For the probable explanation of
this see above, Ch. 14, No. 9.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reader must be on his guard against the error of supposing
that these more than a thousand variations from the Hebrew text are
of such a nature as to affect seriously the system of doctrines and
duties taught in the Pentateuch. They are rather of a critical and
grammatical character, changes which leave the substance of
revelation untouched. See on this point Ch. 3. There is one
striking agreement between the Samaritan text and that of the
Septuagint in which many biblical scholars think that the true
ancient reading has been preserved. It is that of Gen. 4:8: "And
Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go out into the field. And it
came to pass when they were in the field." etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II. OTHER GREEK VERSIONS.</h3>
<p>8. In the beginning of Christianity the Septuagint enjoyed, as
we have seen, a high reputation among the Jews; and as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id=
"page204"></a>{204}</span> natural consequence, among the Jewish
converts also, as well as the Gentile Christians. To the great body
of Gentile believers it was for the Old Testament the only source
of knowledge, as they were ignorant of the Hebrew original. They
studied it diligently, and used it efficiently against the
unbelieving Jews. Hence there naturally arose in the minds of the
latter a feeling of opposition to this version which became very
bitter. They began to disparage its authority, and to accuse it of
misrepresenting the Hebrew. The next step was to oppose to it
another version made by <i>Aquila</i>, which was soon followed by
two others, those of <i>Theodotion</i> and <i>Symmachus</i>.</p>
<p>9. <i>Aquila</i> is represented to have been a Jewish proselyte
of Pontus, and to have lived in the second century. His version was
slavishly literal, following the Hebrew idiom even where it is
contrary to that of the Greek. For this very reason, not
withstanding all the barbarisms thus introduced, the Jews highly
valued it, calling it <i>the Hebrew verity</i>. All that remains of
it to us is contained in the fragments of Origen's Hexapla. See
below, No. 12. Had we the whole work, its extremely literal
character would give it great value in a critical point of view, as
it would shed much light on the state of the Hebrew text when it
was executed.</p>
<p>10. <i>Theodotion</i> was, according to Iren&aelig;us, an
Ephesian. Jerome calls him and Symmachus Ebionites, Judaizing
heretics, and semi-Christians. He is supposed to have made his
version in the last half of the second century. According to the
testimony of the ancients, it had a close resemblance in character
to the Septuagint. He seems to have had this version before him,
and to have made a free use of it. Of the three later versions,
that of Theodotion was most esteemed by the Christians, and they
substituted his translation of the book of Daniel for that of the
Seventy.</p>
<p>11. <i>Symmachus</i>, called by the church fathers an Ebionite,
but by some a Samaritan, seems to have flourished not far from the
close of the second century. His version was free, aiming to give
the sense rather than the words. His idiom was Hellenistic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id=
"page205"></a>{205}</span> and in this respect resembled the
Septuagint, from the author's familiarity with which, indeed, it
probably took its complexion.</p>
<p>Of other ancient Greek versions discovered by Origen in his
Eastern travels and made by unknown authors it is not necessary to
speak.</p>
<p>12. The text of the Septuagint was never preserved so carefully
as that of the Hebrew, and in the days of Origen it had fallen into
great confusion. To meet the objections of the Jews, as well as to
help believers in their study of the Old Testament, Origen
undertook first the work called the <i>Tetrapla</i> (Greek,
<i>fourfold</i>), which was followed by the <i>Hexapla</i> (Greek,
<i>sixfold</i>). To prepare himself he spent twenty-eight years,
travelling extensively and collecting materials. In the Tetrapla,
the text of the Septuagint (corrected by manuscripts of itself),
and those of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus were arranged side
by side in <i>four</i> parallel columns. In the Hexapla there were
<i>six</i> columns&mdash;(1) the Hebrew in Hebrew characters; (2)
the Hebrew expressed in Greek letters; (3) Aquila; (4) Symmachus;
(5) the Septuagint; (6) Theodotion. See Davidson's Bib. Crit., 1,
p. 203; Smith's Bib. Diet., 2, p. 1202. In some books he used two
other Greek versions, and occasionally even a third, giving in the
first case <i>eight</i>, in the second, <i>nine</i> columns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The great work," says Davidson, "consisting of nearly fifty
volumes; on which he had spent the best years of his life, does not
seem to have been transcribed&mdash;probably in consequence of its
magnitude and the great expense necessarily attending a transcript.
It lay unused as a whole fifty years after it was finished, till
Eusebius and Pamphilus drew it forth from its concealment in Tyre,
and placed it in the library of the latter in C&aelig;sarea. It is
thought to have perished there when C&aelig;sarea was taken and
plundered by the Saracens, A.D. 653." Bib. Criticism, 1, p. 206.
Well did Origen merit by his vast researches and labors the epithet
<i>Adamantinus</i> [<i>Adamantine</i>] bestowed on him by the
ancients. Fragments of the Hexapla, consisting of extracts made
from it by the ancients, have been collected and published in two
folio volumes by Montfau&ccedil;on, Paris, 1713, and reprinted by
Bahrdt in two volumes octavo, Leipzig and Lubeck, 1769, 1770. It is
the hope of biblical scholars that these may be enriched from the
Nitrian manuscripts. See further, Chap. 28, No. 8.</p>

version, with the principal editions founded on them, the reader

of Home's Introduction, edition of 1860.</p>
<h3>III. THE CHALDEE TARGUMS.</h3>
<p>13. The Chaldee word <i>Targum</i> means <i>interpretation</i>,
and is applied to the translations or paraphrases of the Old
Testament in the Chaldee language. When, after the captivity, the
Chaldee had supplanted the Hebrew as the language of common life,
it was natural that the Jews should desire to have their sacred
writings in the language which was to them vernacular. Thus we
account, in a natural way, for the origin of these Targums, of
which there is a considerable number now extant differing widely in
age as well as character. No one of them extends to the whole Old
Testament.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question has been raised whether the Targums have for their
authors single individuals, or are the embodiment of traditional
interpretations collected and revised by one or more persons. Many
biblical scholars of the present day incline strongly to the latter
view, which is not in itself improbable. But the decision of the
question, in the case of each Targum, rests not on theory, but on
the character of its contents, as ascertained by careful
examination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>14. The first place in worth, and probably in time also, belongs
to the <i>Targum on the Pentateuch</i> which bears the name of
<i>Onkelos</i>. It is a literal and, upon the whole, an able and
faithful version (not paraphrase) of the Hebrew text, written in
good Aram&aelig;an, and approaching in style to the Chaldee parts
of Daniel and Ezra. In those passages which describe God in
language borrowed from human attributes (<i>anthropomorphic</i>,
<i>describing God in human forms</i>, as having eyes, hands, etc.;
<i>anthropopathic</i>, <i>ascribing to God human affections</i>, as
repenting, grieving, etc.), the author is inclined to use
paraphrases; thus: "And Jehovah smelled a sweet savor" (Gen. 8:21)
becomes in this Targum: "And Jehovah received the sacrifice with
favor;" and "Jehovah went down to see" (Gen. 11:5), "Jehovah
revealed himself." So also strong expressions discreditable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id=
"page207"></a>{207}</span> to the ancient patriarchs are softened,
as: "Rachel <i>took</i>" instead of "Rachel <i>stole</i>." Gen.
31:19. In the poetical passages, moreover, the Targum allows itself
more liberty, and is consequently less satisfactory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a Jewish tradition, Onkelos was a proselyte and
nephew of the emperor Titus, so that he must have flourished about
the time of the destruction of the second temple. But all the
notices we have of his person are very uncertain. There is even
ground for the suspicion that the above tradition respecting
<i>Onkelos</i> relates, by a confusion of persons, to <i>Aquila</i>
(Chaldee <i>Akilas</i>), the author of the Greek version already
considered. In this case the real author of the Targum is unknown,
and we can only say that it should not probably be assigned to a
later date than the close of the second century.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>15. Next in age and value is the <i>Targum of Jonathan Ben
Uzziel</i> on the <i>Prophets</i>; that is, according to the Jewish
classification (Chap. 13, No. 4), Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve Minor Prophets. In the
historical books, this Targum is in the main literal; but in the
prophets (in the stricter sense of the term) paraphrastic and
allegorical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jewish tradition represents that Jonathan wrote the
paraphrase of the prophets from the mouth of Haggai, Zechariah, and
Malachi; a mere fable. Who was the real author cannot be determined
with certainty, only that he lived after the so-called Onkelos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>16. There are two other Targums on the Pentateuch, one of them
commonly known as the <i>Targum of the Pseudo-Jonathan</i> (because
falsely ascribed to the author of the preceding Targum) and the
<i>Jerusalem Targum</i>. The latter is of a fragmentary character;
and its agreement with the corresponding passages of the former is
so remarkable that it is generally considered as consisting of
extracts taken from it with free variations. But according to
Davidson (in Alexander's Kitto): "The Jerusalem Targum formed the
basis of that of Jonathan; and its own basis was that of Onkelos.
Jonathan used both his predecessors' paraphrases; the author of the
Jerusalem Targum that of Onkelos alone." The style of
Pseudo-Jonathan is barbarous, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page208" id="page208"></a>{208}</span> abounding in foreign words,
with the introduction of many legends, fables, and ideas of a later
age. He is assigned to the seventh century. Keil, Introduc. to Old
Testament, &sect; 189.</p>
<p>17. The Targums on the Hagiographa are all of late date. There
is one on <i>Psalms</i>, <i>Job</i>, and <i>Proverbs</i>, the last
tolerably accurate and free from legendary and paraphrastic
additions; one on the <i>five rolls</i>&mdash;Ruth, Esther,
Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Canticles; which is not a translation,
but rather a commentary in the Talmudic style; two on
<i>Esther</i>, one on <i>Chronicles</i>.</p>
<p>In the present connection, though not belonging properly to the
Targums, may be named the <i>Samaritan version of the Samaritan
Pentateuch</i>, printed with the originals in the Paris and London
Polyglotts. It is a literal translation executed in the spirit of
the Targum of Onkelos, and admitting the same class of variations
from the letter of the original.</p>
<h3>IV. THE SYRIAC PESHITO.</h3>
<p>18. This is the oldest version made by Christians from the
original Hebrew. The word <i>Peshito</i> signifies <i>simple</i>,
indicating that it gives the simple meaning of the original,
without paraphrastic and allegorical additions. It is upon the
whole an able and faithful version. It often exhibits a resemblance
to the Alexandrine version. We may readily suppose that the
translator, though rendering from the original Hebrew, was familiar
with the Septuagint, and that this exerted upon his work a certain
degree of influence. The Peshito was the standard version for the
Syriac Christians, being used alike by all parties; a fact which is
naturally explained by its high antiquity. If it be of the same
date as the New Testament Peshito, it may be placed not far from
the close of the second century.</p>
<p>The <i>Old Latin</i>, and in connection with this, the
<i>Vulgate</i> of Jerome, with some other ancient versions of the
Old Testament, will be considered in connection with the New
Testament.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id=
"page209"></a>{209}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>CRITICISM OF THE SACRED TEXT.</h3>
<p>1. The only <i>legitimate criticism</i> of the sacred text is
that which has for its object to restore it, as far as possible, to
its primitive form. Had we the autograph of Moses in the exact form
in which he deposited it in the sanctuary (Deut. 31:26), this would
be a perfect text; and so of any other book of the Old Testament.
In the absence of the autographs, which have all perished, we are
still able to establish the form of their text with a reasonable
degree of certainty for all purposes of faith and practice. The
means of accomplishing this are now to be considered.</p>
<p>2. Here <i>ancient manuscripts</i> hold the first place. It is
obvious, however, that in settling the true reading of a given
passage we cannot look simply to the number of manuscript
testimonies. The <i>quality</i> of the manuscripts must also be
taken into account. Here age is of primary importance. Other things
being equal, the oldest are the most worthy of credence, as being
nearest to the original sources. But, in estimating the testimony
of a manuscript, there are other qualities besides age that must be
carefully considered&mdash;the care of the transcriber; its freedom
from interpolations by later hands (which can, however, as a
general rule, be easily detected); and especially its independence,
that is, its independence as compared with other manuscripts. We
may have a group of manuscripts whose peculiar readings mark them
as having come from a single source. Properly speaking, their
testimony is valid only for the text of their source. The authority
of a single independent manuscript may be equal in weight to their
combined testimony. Then, again, the character of the different
readings must be considered. The easiest reading&mdash;that which
most <span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id=
"page210"></a>{210}</span> naturally suggests itself to the
scribe&mdash;has less presumption in its favor than a more
difficult reading; and that on the simple ground that it is more
likely that an easy should have been substituted for a difficult
reading than the reverse. There are many other points which would
need discussion in a work designed for biblical critics; but for
the purposes of this work the above brief hints are sufficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Masoretic manuscripts have a great degree of uniformity, and
are all comparatively recent. Chap. 14, No. 7. We have reason to
believe that the Hebrew text which they exhibit has a good degree
of purity. But we cannot consider these manuscripts as so many
independent witnesses. The text of the Samaritan Pentateuch is
independent of the Masoretic text. Could we believe that we possess
it in a tolerably pure form, its critical value would be very
great. But, according to the judgment of the best biblical
scholars, it has been subjected to so many alterations, that its
critical authority is of small account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Next in order come <i>ancient versions</i>, the value of
which for critical purposes depends on their character as literal
or free, and also upon the state of their text as we possess it.
Other things being equal, the authority of a version is manifestly
inferior to that of a manuscript of the original. But a version may
have been made from a more ancient form of the original text than
any which we have in existing manuscripts; and thus it may be
indirectly a witness of great value. The extremely literal version
of Aquila (Chap. 16, No. 9) was made in the second century. Could
we recover it, its testimony to the Hebrew text, as it then
existed, would be of great value. The Septuagint version was made
(at least begun) in the third century before Christ. But its free
character diminishes, and the impure state of its text greatly
injures its critical authority. Of the Targums, those of Onkelos
and Jonathan alone are capable of rendering any service in the line
of sacred criticism, and this is not of much account.</p>
<p>4. We have also <i>primary-printed editions</i> of the Hebrew
Bible&mdash;those printed from Hebrew manuscripts, which the reader
may see noticed in Horne's Bibliographical List, Appendix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id=
"page211"></a>{211}</span> to vol. 4. The critical authority of
these depends on that of the manuscripts used, which were all of
the Masoretic recension.</p>
<p>5. <i>Parallel passages</i>&mdash;parallel in a <i>critical</i>
and not simply in a <i>historical</i> respect&mdash;are passages
which profess not merely to give an account of the same
transaction, but to repeat the same text. Well known examples are:
the song of David recorded in the twenty-second chapter of the
second book of Samuel, and repeated as the eighteenth psalm; the
fourteenth and fifty-third psalms, etc. Such repetitions possess
for every biblical student a high interest. But in the
<i>critical</i> use of them great caution is necessary. It must be
ascertained, first of all, whether they proceed from the same, or
from a different writer. In the latter case they are only
historical imitations. If, as in the case of the above-named
passages, they manifestly have the same author, the inquiry still
remains <i>how</i> the differences arose. They may be different
recensions of the same writer (in this case, of David himself), or
of another inspired writer, who thus sought to adapt them more
perfectly&mdash;the fifty-third psalm, for example&mdash;to the
circumstances of his own day. The gift of inspiration made the
later writer, in this respect, co&ouml;rdinate in authority with
the earlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Historical</i> parallelism, such as those in the books of
Chronicles, as compared with the earlier historical books, do not
properly belong here. Yet these also sometimes furnish critical
help, especially in respect to names and dates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. The <i>quotations</i> from the Old Testament <i>in the
New</i> have for every believer the highest authority; more,
however, in a <i>hermeneutical</i> than a <i>critical</i> respect.
For, as already remarked (Chap. 16, No. 6), the New Testament
writers quote mostly from the Septuagint, and in a very free way.
The whole subject of these quotations will come up hereafter under
the head of Biblical Interpretation.</p>
<p>7. <i>Quotations</i> from the Old Testament in the <i>Talmud</i>
and <i>later rabbinical writers</i> are another source of sacred
criticism. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id=
"page212"></a>{212}</span> The Talmud, embodying the ecclesiastical
and civil law of the Jews according to their traditions, consists
of two parts, the <i>Mishna</i>, or text, generally referred to the
last half of the second century, and the <i>Gemara</i>, or
<i>commentary</i> on the Mishna. The Mishna is one; but connected
with this are two Gemaras of later origin; the more copious
<i>Babylonian</i>, and the briefer <i>Jerusalem</i> Gemara; whence
the distinction of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud. Whether
because the Hebrew text was rigidly settled in its present form in
the days of the Talmudists, or because their quotations have been
made to agree with the Masorah, an examination of the Talmud
furnishes few various readings that are of any importance. Most of
them relate to trifling particulars. The quotations of later
rabbinical writers are of small account in a critical respect.</p>
<p>8. It remains to speak of <i>critical conjecture</i>. Of this a
wise and reverent scholar will make a very cautious use. He will
content himself with offering to the public his suggestions,
without venturing to incorporate them into the text itself. The
recklessness of some modern critics, who make an abundance of
conjectural emendations, and then embody them in their versions,
with only a brief note, deserves severe condemnation. Had the
ancient critics generally adopted this uncritical method, the
sacred text would long ago have fallen into irretrievable
confusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We add an example where critical conjecture is in place, though
it may not venture to alter the established reading. In Psalm 42,
the last clause of verse 6 and the beginning of verse 7, written
continuously without a division of words (Chap. 13, No. 5), would
read thus:</p>
<p>[Hebrew: ky'od'odnu'sho'tpnyu'lhy'lynpshytshtvhh]</p>
<p>With the present division of words:</p>
<p>[Hebrew: ky 'od 'odnu 'sho't pnyu 'lhy 'ly npshy tshtvhh]</p>
<p>the clauses are to be translated, as in our version:</p>
<p><i>For I shall yet praise him</i> [for] <i>the salvation of his
countenance. O my God, my soul is cast down within me</i>.</p>
<p>Divided as follows (by the transfer of a single letter to the
following word).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id=
"page213"></a>{213}</span>
<p>[Hebrew: ky 'od 'odnu 'sho't pny u'lhy 'ly npshy tshtvhh]</p>
<p>the rendering would be:</p>
<p><i>For I shall yet praise him</i>, [who is] <i>the salvation of
my countenance and my God. My soul is cast down within me</i>.</p>
<p>Thus the refrain would agree exactly with the two that follow
(ver. 11 and 43:5). Yet this conjecture, however plausible, is
uncertain, since we do not know that the sacred writer sought exact
uniformity in the three refrains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>9. <i>General remark</i> on the various readings of the sacred
text. As a general rule, the various readings with which textual
criticism is occupied have respect to minor points&mdash;for the
most part points of a trivial nature; and even where the variations
are of more importance, they are not of such a character as to
obscure, much less change, the truths of revelation in any
essential respect. Biblical critics tell us, for example, that the
Samaritan Pentateuch agrees with the Septuagint version in more
than a thousand places where they differ from the Masoretic Hebrew
text. Chap. 16, No. 7. Yet these three texts all exhibit the same
God, and the same system of doctrines and duties. Revelation does
not lie in letters and syllables and grammatical forms, but in the
deep and pure and strong and broad current of truth "given by
inspiration of God." Reverence for the inspired word makes us
anxious to possess the sacred text in all possible purity. Yet if
we cannot attain to absolute perfection in this respect, we have
reasonable assurance that God, who gave the revelation contained in
the Old Testament, has preserved it to us unchanged in any
essential particular. The point on which most obscurity and
uncertainty rests is that of scriptural chronology; and this is not
one that affects Christian faith or practice.</p>

<h2>SECOND DIVISION: PARTICULAR INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AS A WHOLE.</h3>
<p>1. The province of <i>Particular Introduction</i> is to consider
the books of the Bible separately, in respect to their authorship,
date, contents, and the place which each of them holds in the
system of divine truth. Here it is above all things important that
we begin with the idea of the <i>unity of divine
revelation</i>&mdash;that all the parts of the Bible constitute a
gloriously perfect whole, of which God and not man is the author.
No amount of study devoted to a given book or section of the Old
Testament, with all the help that modern scholarship can furnish,
will give a true comprehension of it, until we understand it in its
relations to the rest of Scripture, We cannot, for example,
understand the book of Genesis out of connection with the four
books that follow, nor the book of Deuteronomy separated from the
four that precede. Nor can we fully understand the Pentateuch as a
whole except in the light of the historical and prophetical books
which follow; for these unfold the divine purpose in the
establishment of the Theocracy as recorded in the Pentateuch. The
Pentateuch itself gives us only the <i>constitution</i> of the
Theocracy. The books that follow, taken in connection with, the New
Testament, reveal its <i>office</i> in the plan of redemption; and
not till we know this can we be said to have an intelligent
comprehension of the theocratic system. The same is true of every
other part of revelation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The words of the apostle: "Ever learning, and never able to come
to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Tim. 3:7), apply to many learned
commentaries. Their authors have brought to them much accurate
scholarship <span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id=
"page215"></a>{215}</span> and research; but they have not seen the
unity of divine truth. They have written mainly in an antiquarian
spirit and interest, regarding the work under consideration simply
as an ancient and venerable record. They have diligently sought for
connections in philology, in antiquities, and in history. In these
respects they have thrown much light on the sacred text. But they
have never once thought of inquiring what place the book which they
have undertaken to interpret holds in the divine system of
revelation&mdash;perhaps have had no faith in such a system.
Consequently they cannot unfold to others that which they do not
themselves apprehend. On a hundred particulars they may give
valuable information, but that which constitutes the very life and
substance of the book remains hidden from their view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. It is necessary that we understand, first of all, the
relation of the Old Testament as a whole to the system of revealed
truth. It is a <i>preparatory</i> revelation introductory to one
that is <i>final</i>. This the New Testament teaches in explicit
terms. "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
Son." Gal. 4:4. Christ could not have come in the days of Enoch
before the flood, nor of Abraham after the flood, because "the
fulness of the time" had not yet arrived. Nor was the way for his
advent prepared in the age of Moses, or David, or Isaiah, or Ezra.
The gospel everywhere assumes that when the Saviour appeared, men
had attained to a state of comparative maturity in respect to both
the knowledge of God and the progress of human society. The
attentive reader of the New Testament cannot fail to notice how
fully its writers avail themselves of all the revelations which God
had made in the Old Testament of himself, of the course of his
providence, and of his purposes towards the human family. The
<i>unity of God</i>, especially, is assumed as a truth so firmly
established in the national faith of the Jews, that the doctrine of
our Lord's deity, and that of the Holy Spirit, can be taught
without the danger of its being misunderstood in a polytheistic
sense&mdash;as if the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were
three gods. It is certain that this could not have been done any
time before the Babylonish captivity. The idea of <i>vicarious
sacrifice</i>, moreover&mdash;that great fundamental idea of the
gospel that "without shedding of blood there is no
remission"&mdash;the writers of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page216" id="page216"></a>{216}</span> New Testament found ready
at hand, and in its light they interpreted the mission of Christ.
Upon his very first appearance, John the Baptist, his forerunner,
exclaimed to the assembled multitudes: "Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh away the sin of the world." To the Jew, with his
training under the Mosaic system of sacrifices, how significant
were these words! Without such a previous training, how meaningless
to him and to the world for which Christ died! Then again the
gospel, in strong contrast with the Mosaic law, deals in <i>general
principles</i>. Herein it assumes a comparative maturity of human
thought&mdash;a capacity to include many particulars under one
general idea. A beautiful illustration of this is our Lord's
summary of social duties; "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the
law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12. We may add (what is indeed
implied in the preceding remark) that the gospel required for its
introduction a <i>well-developed state of civilization</i> and
culture, as contrasted with one of rude barbarism. Now the Hebrews
were introduced, in the beginning of their national existence, to
the civilization of Egypt; which, with all its defects, was perhaps
as good a type as then existed in the world. Afterwards they were
brought successively into intimate connection with Babylonian,
Persian, Grecian, and Roman civilization; particularly with the
last two. This was, moreover, at a time when their national
training under the Mosaic institutions had given them such maturity
of religious character that they were not in danger of being
seduced into the idolatrous worship of these nations. Dispersed
throughout all the provinces of the Roman empire, they still
maintained firmly the religion of their fathers; and their
synagogues everywhere constituted central points for the
introduction of the gospel, and its diffusion through the Gentile
world. Such are some of the many ways in which the world was
prepared for the Redeemer's advent. This is a vast theme, on which
volumes could be written. The plan of the present work will only
admit of the above brief hints.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id=
"page217"></a>{217}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Lord's command is: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature." The history of missions shows that the
gospel can be preached with success to the most degraded
tribes&mdash;to the Hottentots of South Africa and the cannibals of
the South sea islands, and that this is the only remedy for their
barbarism. But the gospel did not <i>begin</i> among savages, nor
does it have its centres of power and influence among them. Christ
came at the culminating point of ancient civilization and culture;
not that he might conform his gospel to existing institutions and
ideas, but that he might through his gospel infuse into them (as
far as they contained elements of truth) the purifying and
transforming leaven of divine truth. As the gospel began in the
midst of civilization, so does its introduction among barbarous
tribes always bring civilization in its train.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. When we have learned to regard the revelation of which we
have a record in the Old Testament as preparatory to the gospel, we
see it in its true light. This view furnishes both the key to its
character and the answer to the objections commonly urged against
it. It is not a revelation of abstract truths. These would neither
have excited the interest of the people, nor have been apprehended
by them. God made known to the covenant people his character and
the duties which he required of them by a series of <i>mighty
acts</i> and a system of <i>positive laws</i>. The Old Testament,
is, therefore, in an eminent degree <i>documentary</i>&mdash;a
record not simply of opinions, but rather of actions and
institutions. Of these actions and institutions we are to judge
from the character of the people and the age in connection with the
great end proposed by God. This end was not the material prosperity
of Israel, but the preparation of the nation for its high office as
the medium through which the gospel should afterwards be given to
the world. The people were rebellious and stiff-necked, and
surrounded by polytheism and idolatry. Their training required
severity, and all the severity employed by God brought forth at
last its appropriate fruits. The laws imposed upon them were stern
and burdensome from their multiplicity. But no one can show that in
either of these respects they could have been wisely modified; for
the nation was then in its childhood and pupilage (Gal. 4:1-3), and
needed to be treated accordingly.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id=
"page218"></a>{218}</span>
<p>An objection much insisted on by some is the <i>exclusive</i>
character of the Mosaic institutions&mdash;a religion, it is
alleged, for only one nation, while all the other nations were left
in ignorance. To this a summary answer can be given. In selecting
Israel as his covenant people, God had in view the salvation of the
whole world: "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed"
(Gen. 12:3)&mdash;such was the tenor of the covenant from the
beginning. His plan was to bring one nation into special relation
to himself, establish in it the true religion, prepare it for the
advent of Christ, and then propagate the gospel from it as a centre
throughout all nations. If men are to be dealt with in a moral way,
as free, responsible subjects of law (and this is the only way in
which God deals with men under a system of either natural or
revealed religion), can the objector propose any better way? He
might as well object to the procedure of a military commander that,
instead of spreading his army over a whole province, he
concentrates it on one strong point. Let him wait patiently, and he
will find that in gaining this point the commander gains the whole
country.</p>
<p>4. Having seen the relation of the Old Testament as a whole to
the system of divine revelation, we are now prepared to consider
the place occupied by its <i>several divisions</i>.</p>
<p>(1.) To prepare the way for our Lord's advent, one nation was to
be selected and trained up under a system of divine laws and
ordinances&mdash;the <i>theocracy</i> established under Moses. The
<i>Pentateuch</i> records <i>the establishment of the
theocracy</i>, with the previous steps that led to it, and the
historical events immediately connected with. it. Hence the five
books of Moses are called emphatically <i>the Law</i>; and as such,
their province in the Old Testament is clear and well defined.</p>
<p>(2.) The end of the Mosaic law being the preparation of the
Israelitish people, and through them the world, for Christ's
advent, it was not the purpose of God that it should be hidden as a
dead letter beside the ark in the inner sanctuary. It was a code
for practice, not for theory. It contained the constitution of the
state, civil as well as religious; and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>{219}</span> God's
almighty power and faithfulness were pledged that it should
accomplish in a thorough way the office assigned to it. The
theocracy must therefore have a <i>history</i>; and with the record
of this the <i>historical books</i> are occupied.</p>
<p>(3.) God did not leave the development of this history to
itself. He watched over it from the beginning, and directed its
course, interposing from time to time, not only in a providential
way, but also by direct revelation. Sometimes, for specific ends,
he revealed himself immediately <i>to</i> particular individuals,
as to Gideon, and Manoah and his wife. But more commonly his
revelations were made to the rulers or people at large
<i>through</i> persons selected as the organs of his Spirit; that
is, through <i>prophets</i>. The prophet held his commission
immediately from God. Since God is the author, not of confusion,
but of order, he came to the people <i>under</i> the Law, not above
it; and his messages were to be tried by the Law. Deut. 13:1-5. No
prophet after Moses enjoyed the same fulness of access to God which
was vouchsafed to him, or received the same extent of revelation.
Numb. 12:6-8; Deut. 34:10-12. Nevertheless, the prophet came to
rulers and people, like Moses, with an authority derived
immediately from God, introducing his messages with the words:
"Thus saith the Lord." In God's name he rebuked the people for
their sins; explained to them the true cause of the calamities that
befell them; recalled them to God's service as ordained in the Law,
unfolding to them at the same time its true nature as consisting in
the spirit, and not in the letter only&mdash;1 Sam. 15:22; Isa.
1:11-20; 57:15; 66:2; Jer. 4:4; Ezek. 18:31; Hosea 10:12; 14:2;
Joel 2:12, 13; Amos 5: 21-24; Micah 6: 6-8&mdash;denounced upon
them the awful judgments of God as the punishment of continued
disobedience; and promised them the restoration of his favor upon
condition of hearty repentance. In the decline of the Theocracy, it
was the special province of the prophets to comfort the pious
remnant of God's people by unfolding to them the future glory of
Zion&mdash;the true "Israel of God," and her dominion over all the
earth. From about the reign of Uzziah and onward, as <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>{220}</span> already
remarked (ch. 15. 12), the prophets began, under the guidance of
the Holy Spirit, to reduce their prophecies to writing, and thus
arose the series of <i>prophetical books</i> that form a prominent
part of the Old Testament canon. Their office is at once recognized
by every reader as distinct from that of either the Pentateuch or
the historical books; although these latter were, as a general
rule, written by prophets also.</p>
<p>(4.) There is a class, more miscellaneous in character, that may
be described in general terms as the <i>poetical books</i>, in
which the elements of meditation and reflection predominate. It
includes the book of Job, which has for its theme divine
providence, as viewed from the position of the Old Testament; the
book of Psalms, that wonderful treasury of holy thought and feeling
embodied in sacred song for the use of God's people in all ages;
the book of Proverbs, with its inexhaustible treasures of practical
wisdom; the book of Ecclesiastes, having for its theme the vanity
of this world when sought as a satisfying good; and the book of
Canticles, which the church has always regarded as a mystical song
having for its ground-idea, under the Old Testament, that God is
the husband of Zion, and under the New, that the church is the
bride of Christ. How high a place this division of the canon holds
in the system of divine revelation every pious heart feels
instinctively. Without it, the revelation of the Old Testament
could not have been complete for the work assigned to it.</p>
<p>5. We have seen the relation of the Old Testament as a whole to
the entire system of revelation, and also the place occupied by its
several divisions. It will further appear, as we proceed, that each
particular book in these divisions contributes its share to the
perfection of the whole.</p>
<p>6. Although the revelation contained in the Old Testament was
preparatory to the fuller revelation of the New, we must guard
against the error of supposing that it had not a proper
significance and use for the men of its own time. "Unto us," says
the apostle, "was the gospel preached, <i>as well as unto
them</i>." Heb. 4:2. And again: "These all died in faith, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id=
"page221"></a>{221}</span> having received the promises, but having
seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them,
and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
received not the promise: God having provided some better tiling
for us, <i>that they without us should not be made perfect</i>."
Heb. 11:13, 39, 40. They had a part of the truth, but not its
fulness; and the measure of revelation vouchsafed to them was given
for their personal salvation, as well as to prepare the way for
further revelations. The promise made to Abraham&mdash;"In thy seed
shall all the nations of the earth be blessed"&mdash;was fulfilled
in Christ. In this respect Abraham "received not the promise."
Nevertheless, it was a promise made for his benefit, as well as for
that of future ages. Into the bosom of the patriarch it brought
light and joy and salvation. "Your father Abraham," said Jesus,
"rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad." John 8:56.
"He believed in the Lord," says the inspired record, "and he
counted it to him for righteousness." Gen. 15:6. The deliverance of
Israel from Egypt typified the redemption of Christ; and it was,
moreover, one of the grand movements that prepared the way for his
advent. But it was neither all type nor all preparation. To the
covenant people of that day it was a true deliverance; and to the
believing portion of them, a deliverance of soul as well as of
body. "The law," says Paul, "was our school-master to bring us unto
Christ, that we might be justified by faith." Gal. 3:24. But while
it had this preparatory office, it was to the Israelitish nation a
true rule of life; and under it many, through faith, anticipated
its end. The prophets prophesied for the men of their own age, as
well as for distant generations. The sweet psalmist of Israel,
while he foreshadowed the Messiah's reign, sung for the comfort and
edification of himself and his contemporaries; and Solomon gave
rules of practical wisdom as valid for his day as for ours. The
revelation of the Old Testament was not complete, like that which
we now possess; but it was sufficient for the salvation of every
sincere inquirer after truth. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span> When the rich man in hell
besought Abraham that Lazarus might be sent to warn his five
brethren on the ground that, if one went to them from the dead they
would repent, Abraham answered: "If they hear not Moses and the
prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the
dead."</p>
<p>7. There is another practical error against which Christians of
the present day need to be warned. It is the idea that the full
revelation of the New Testament supersedes in a great measure the
necessity of studying the previous revelation contained in the Old
Testament. Few will openly avow this, but too many inwardly cherish
the delusion in a vague and undefined form; and it exerts a
pernicious influence upon them, leading them to undervalue and
neglect the Old Testament Scriptures. Even if the idea under
consideration were in accordance with truth, it would still be to
every earnest Christian a matter of deep historical interest to
study the way by which God prepared the world for the full light of
the gospel. But it is not true. It rests on a foundation of error
and delusion. For, (1.) The system of divine revelation constitutes
a <i>whole</i>, all the parts of which are connected, from
beginning to end, so that no single part can be truly understood
without a knowledge of all the rest. The impenetrable darkness that
rests on some portions of Scripture has its ground in the fact that
the plan of redemption is not yet completed. The mighty disclosures
of the future can alone dissipate this darkness.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"God is his own interpreter,</p>
<p>And he will make it plain."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>(2.) We know that the writers of the New Testament constantly
refer to the Old for arguments and illustrations. A knowledge of
the Old Testament is necessary, therefore, for a full comprehension
of their meaning. How can the reader, for example, understand the
epistles to the Romans and Galatians, or that to the Hebrews,
without a thorough acquaintance with "Moses and the prophets," to
which these epistles have such constant reference? (3.) The Old
Testament is occupied with the record of God's dealings with men.
Such a record must <span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id=
"page223"></a>{223}</span> be a perpetual revelation of God's
infinite attributes, and of human character also, and the course of
human society, every part of which is luminous with instruction.
(4.) Although the old theocracy, with its particular laws and forms
of worship, has passed away, yet the <i>principles</i> on which it
rested, which interpenetrated it in every part, and which shone
forth with a clear light throughout its whole history&mdash;these
principles are eternal verities, as valid for us as for the ancient
patriarchs. Some of these principles&mdash;for example, God's
unity, personality, and infinite perfections; his universal
providence; his supremacy over all nations; the tendency of nations
to degeneracy, and the stern judgments employed by God to reclaim
them&mdash;are so fully unfolded in the Old Testament that they
needed no repetition in the New. There they became <i>axioms</i>
rather than doctrines. (5.) "The manifold wisdom of God" in
adapting his dealings with men to the different stages of human
progress cannot be seen without a diligent study of the Old
Testament as well as the New. Whoever neglects the former, will
want breadth and comprehensiveness of Christian culture. All
profound Christian writers have been well versed in "the whole
instrument of each Testament," as Tertullian calls the two parts of
revelation. Chap. 13, No. 2.</p>
<p>Modern skepticism begins with disparaging the Old Testament, and
ends with denying the divine authority of both the Old and the New.
In this work it often unites a vast amount of learning in regard to
particulars with principles that are superficial and false.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>THE PENTATEUCH.</h3>
<p>1. The <i>unity of the Pentateuch</i> has already been
considered (Ch. 9, No. 12), and will appear more fully as we
proceed with the examination of the separate books included in it.
Even if we leave out of view the authority of the New Testament,
this unity is too deep and fundamental to allow of the idea that it
is a patchwork of later ages. Under divine guidance the writer goes
steadily forward from beginning to end, and his work when finished
is a symmetrical whole. Even its apparent incongruities, like the
interweaving of historical notices with the laws, are marks of its
genuineness; for they prove that, in those parts at least, events
were recorded as they transpired. Such a blending of history with
revelation does not impair the unity of the work; for it is a unity
which has its ground not in severe logical arrangement and
classification, but in a divine plan historically developed.
Whether the division of the Pentateuch into five books (whence its
Greek name <i>Pentateuchos</i>, <i>fivefold book</i>) was original,
proceeding from the author himself, or the work of a later age, is
a question on which biblical scholars are not agreed. It is
admitted by all that the division is natural and appropriate. The
Hebrew titles of the several books are taken from prominent words
standing at or near the beginning of each. The Greek names are
expressive of their prominent contents; and these are followed in
the Latin Vulgate and in our English version, only that the name of
the fourth book is translated.</p>
<h3>I. GENESIS.</h3>
<p>2. The Hebrews <i>name</i> this book <i>Bereshith</i>, <i>in the
beginning</i>, from the first word. Its Greek name <i>Genesis</i>
signifies <i>generation</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page225" id="page225"></a>{225}</span> <i>genealogy</i>. As the
genealogical records with which the book abounds contain historical
notices, and are, in truth, the earliest form of history, the word
is applied to the history of the creation, and of the ancient
patriarchs, as well as to the genealogical lists of their families.
Gen. 2:4; 25:19; 37:2 etc. In the same wide sense is it applied to
the book itself.</p>
<p>3. Genesis is the <i>introductory book</i> to the Pentateuch,
without which our understanding of the following books would be
incomplete. Let us suppose for a moment that we had not this book.
We open the book of Exodus and read of "the children of Israel
which came into Egypt;" that "Joseph was in Egypt already," and
that "there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph."
Who were these children of Israel? we at once ask; and how did they
come to be in Egypt? Who was Joseph? and what is the meaning of the
notice that the new king knew not Joseph? All these particulars are
explained in the book of Genesis, and without them we must remain
in darkness. But the connection of this book with the following is
not simply explanatory; it is <i>organic</i> also, entering into
the very substance of the Pentateuch. We are told (Ex. 2:24, 25)
that God heard the groaning of his people in Egypt, and "God
remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;
and God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect
unto them." The remembrance of his covenant with their fathers is
specified as the ground of his interposition. Now the covenant made
with Abraham, and afterwards renewed to Isaac and Jacob, was not a
mere incidental event in the history of the patriarchs and their
posterity. It constituted the very essence of God's peculiar
relation to Israel; and, as such, it was the platform on which the
whole theocracy was afterwards erected. The nation received the law
at Sinai <i>in pursuance</i> of the original covenant made with
their fathers; and unless we understand the nature of this
covenant, we fail to understand the meaning and end of the law
itself. The very information which we need is contained in Genesis;
for from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id=
"page226"></a>{226}</span> the twelfth chapter onward this book is
occupied with an account of this covenant, and of God's dealings
with the patriarchs in connection with it. The story of Joseph,
which unites such perfect simplicity with such deep pathos, is not
thrown in as a pleasing episode. Its end is to show how God
accomplished his purpose, long before announced to Abraham (ch.
15:13), that the Israelites should be "a stranger in a land not
theirs."</p>
<p>But the Abrahamic covenant itself finds its explanation in the
previous history. For two thousand years God had administered the
government of the world without a visible church. And what was the
result? Before the flood the degeneracy of the human family was
universal. God, therefore, swept them all away, and began anew with
Noah and his family. But the terrible judgment of the deluge was
not efficacious to prevent the new world from following the example
of the old. In the days of Abraham the worship of God had been
corrupted through polytheism and idolatry, and ignorance and
wickedness were again universal. The time had manifestly come for
the adoption of a new economy, in which God should, for the time
being, concentrate his special labors upon a single nation but with
ultimate reference to the salvation of the whole world. Thus we
have in the book of Genesis in a certain measure (for we may not
presume to speak of God's counsels as fully apprehended by us) an
explanation of the Abrahamic covenant, and, in this, of the Mosaic
economy also.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with the above view, the book of Genesis falls
into two unequal, but natural divisions. The <i>first</i> part
extends through eleven chapters, and is occupied with the history
of <i>the human family as a whole</i>. It is the oldest record in
existence, and its contents are perfectly unique. It describes in
brief terms: the order of creation; the institution of the Sabbath
and marriage; the probation to which man was subjected, with its
disastrous result in his fall and expulsion from Eden; the murder
of Abel by Cain, and, in connection with this, the division of
mankind into two families; man's universal <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>{227}</span>
degeneracy; the deluge; the covenant made by God with the earth
through Noah, and the law of murder; the confusion of tongues at
Babel, and the consequent dispersion of the different families of
men, a particular account of which is given by way of anticipation
in the tenth chapter. In addition to these notices there are two
genealogical tables; the first from Adam to Noah (ch. 5), the
second from Shem to Abraham (ch. 11).</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> part comprises the remainder of the book. In
this we have no longer a history of the whole race, but of
Abraham's family, with only incidental notices of the nations into
connection with whom Abraham and his posterity were brought. It
opens with an account of the call of Abraham and the covenant made
with him; notices the repeated renewal of this covenant to Abraham,
with the institution of the rite of circumcision; its subsequent
renewal to Isaac and Jacob; and the exclusion, first of Ishmael and
afterwards of Esau, from a share in its privileges. In immediate
connection with the covenant relation into which God took Abraham
and his family, we have the history of the patriarchs, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, sometimes with much detail, but always with
reference to the peculiar prerogative conferred upon them. The book
closes with an account of the wonderful train of providences by
which Israel was brought into Egypt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Ishmael and Esau were excluded from the covenant, yet,
apparently in consequence of their near relation to the patriarchs,
genealogical tables are devoted to them; to Ishmael, ch. 25:12-18;
to Esau, the whole of ch. 36.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. The <i>Mosaic authorship</i> of Genesis has already been
considered; and, in connection with this, the question whether the
Pentateuch, and especially Genesis, contains any clauses of a later
date, Ch. 9, No. 11. Some, as Hengstenberg and his followers, deny
the existence of such clauses; but others think that a few must be
admitted, which were afterwards added, as needful explanations, by
prophetical men. We are at liberty <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page228" id="page228"></a>{228}</span> to decide either way
concerning them according to the evidence before us. On the
question whether Moses made use of earlier written documents, see
Ch. 9, No. 11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clauses for which a later date can with any show of reason
be claimed are few in number, and none of them enter essentially
into the texture of the book. They are just such extraneous remarks
as the necessities of a later age required; for example, Gen.
36:31; Ex. 16:35. On the last of these, Graves, who considers it
"<i>plainly a passage inserted by a later hand</i>," says: "I
contend that the insertion of such notes rather confirms than
impeaches the integrity of the original narrative. If this were a
compilation long subsequent to the events it records" (according to
the false assumption of some respecting the origin of the
Pentateuch), "such additions would not have been plainly
distinguishable, as they now are, from the main substance of the
original." On the Pentateuch, Appendix, sec. 1, No. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. The contents of the first part of this book are peculiar. It
is not strange, therefore, that we should encounter
<i>difficulties</i> in the attempt to interpret them. To consider
these difficulties in detail would be to write a commentary on the
first eleven chapters. Only some general remarks can here be
offered. Some difficulties are imaginary, the inventions of special
pleading. In these the commentaries of modern rationalists abound.
They are to be set aside by fair interpretation. But other
difficulties are real, and should not be denied or ignored by the
honest expositor. If he can give a valid explanation of them, well
and good; but if not, let him reverently wait for more light, in
the calm assurance that the divine authority of the Pentateuch
rests on a foundation that cannot be shaken. To deny a
well-authenticated narrative of facts on the ground of unexplained
difficulties connected with it is to build on a foundation of
error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A.) Of the difficulties connected with the first part of
Genesis some are <i>scientific</i>. Such is the narrative of the
creation of the world in six days. Respecting this it has already
been remarked (Ch. 10, No. 3) that with all who believe in the
reality of divine revelation the question is not respecting the
truth of this narrative, but respecting the interpretation of it.
As long ago as the time of Augustine the question was raised
whether these days <span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id=
"page229"></a>{229}</span> are to be understood literally, or
symbolically of long periods of time. The latter was his view, and
it is strengthened by the analogy of the prophetic days of
prophecy.</p>
<p>Another difficulty relates to the age of the antediluvian
patriarchs, which was about tenfold the present term of life for
robust and healthful men. According to the laws of physiology we
must suppose that the period of childhood and youth was protracted
in a corresponding manner; since in man, as in all the higher
animals, the time of physical growth&mdash;physical growth in the
widest sense, the process of arriving at physical
maturity&mdash;has a fixed relation to the whole term of existence.
After the deluge, in some way not understood by us, the whole
course of human life began to be gradually quickened&mdash;to run
its round in a shorter time&mdash;till the age of man was at last
reduced to its present measure. All that we can say here is that we
do not know how God accomplished this result. He accomplished it in
a secret and invisible way, as he does so many other of his
operations in nature. On the discrepancy between the Masoretic
Hebrew text, the text of the Samaritan Pentateuch, and that of the
Septuagint, in respect to the genealogical tables in Genesis, see
below.</p>
<p>The <i>unity of the human race</i> is everywhere assumed in
Scripture. Some modern scientific men have denied this, but their
arguments for a diversity of origin do not amount to positive
proof. They are theoretic rather than demonstrative, and the weight
of evidence is against them. We must remember, moreover, that man
lives under a supernatural dispensation. The narrative in the
eleventh chapter of Genesis seems to imply that God interposed
miraculously to confound human speech, in accordance with his plan
to scatter men "abroad upon the face of all the earth." In like
manner he may have interposed in a secret way to intensify the
diversity in the different races of men. It does not appear
certain, however, on physiological grounds, that any miraculous
interposition was needed; and we may leave the question of the
manner in which the present diversity among the children of Adam
was produced among the secret things of which it is not necessary
that we should have an explanation.</p>
<p>The question of the <i>universality of the deluge</i> is with
believers in revelation one of words only, on which it is hardly
necessary to waste time. The <i>end</i> of the deluge was the
complete destruction of the human race, all but Noah and his
family. This it accomplished, and why need we raise any further
inquiries; as, for example, whether the polar lands, where no man
has ever trod, were submerged also? "All the high hills under the
whole heaven" doubtless included all the high hills where man
lived, and which, therefore, were known to man.</p>
<p>(B.) Another class of difficulties is <i>historical</i>,
consisting in alleged inconsistencies and disagreements between
different parts of the narrative. For the details of these, the
reader must be referred to the commentaries. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>{230}</span> One or
two only can be noticed as specimens of the whole. It is said that
the second account of the creation (Gen. 2:4-25) is inconsistent
with the first; the order of creation in the first being animals,
then man; in the second, man, then animals. But the answer is
obvious. In the first account, the order of succession in the
several parts of creation is one of the main features. It
distinctly announces that, <i>after</i> God had finished the rest
of his works, he made man in his own image. The second account, on
the other hand, which is introductory to the narrative of man's sin
and expulsion from Eden, takes no notice of the order of creation
in its several parts. In this, man is the <i>central</i> object,
and other things are mentioned incidentally in their relation to
man. The writer has no occasion to speak of trees good for food
till a <i>home</i> is sought for Adam; nor of beasts and birds till
a <i>companion</i> is needed for him. Then each of these things is
mentioned in connection with him. No candid interpreter can infer
from this that the second account means to give, as the veritable
order of creation&mdash;man, the garden of Eden, beasts and
birds!</p>
<p>A difficulty has been alleged, also, in regard to <i>Cain's
wife</i>. But this grows simply out of the brevity of the sacred
narrative. The children of Adam must have intermarried, brothers
and sisters. The fact that no daughter is mentioned as born to Adam
before Seth, is no evidence against the birth of daughters long
before. In the fourth chapter no individuals are mentioned except
for special reasons&mdash;Cain and Abel, with a genealogical list
of Cain's family to Lamech, because he was the head of one branch
of the human race before the deluge. In the fifth chapter none are
named but <i>sons in the line of Noah</i>, with the standing
formula of "sons and daughters" born afterwards. We are not to
infer from this that no sons or daughters were born before;
otherwise we should exclude Cain and Abel themselves. At the time
of the murder of Abel, the two brothers were adult men. What was
their age we cannot tell. It may have been a hundred years or more;
for our first parents were created not infants, but in the maturity
of their powers, and Adam was one hundred and thirty years old when
the next son after Abel's murder was born. Gen. 4:25. At all
events, the interval between Abel's birth and death must have been
long, and we cannot reasonably suppose that during this period no
daughters were born to Adam.</p>
<p>(C.) The <i>chronology</i> of the book of Genesis involves, as
is well known, some difficult questions. In the genealogical tables
contained in the fifth and eleventh chapters, the texts of the
Masoretic Hebrew (which is followed in our version),
Hebrew-Samaritan, and Septuagint, differ in a remarkable
manner.</p>
<p>(1.) <i>Antediluvian Genealogy.</i> According to the Septuagint,
no patriarch has a son before the age of one hundred years. It adds
to the age of each of the five patriarchs that preceded Jared, and
also to the age of Enoch, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"
id="page231"></a>{231}</span> one hundred years before the birth of
his son, deducting the same from his life afterwards. To the age of
Lamech it adds six years before the birth of Noah, deducting thirty
years afterwards. In respect to the age of Methuselah when Lamech
was born, there is a difference of twenty years between the Vatican
and the Alexandrine manuscripts. The latter agrees with the
Masoretic text: the former gives one hundred and sixty-seven
instead of one hundred and eighty-seven. Thus the Septuagint makes
the period from the creation to the deluge 2262 years (according to
the Vatican manuscript 2242 years) against the 1656 of our
Masoretic text.</p>
<p>The Samaritan-Hebrew text agrees with the Masoretic for the
first five patriarchs and for Enoch. From the age of Jared it
deducts one hundred years; from that of Methuselah one hundred and
twenty (one hundred according to the Vatican manuscript of the
Septuagint); and from that of Lamech, one hundred and
twenty-nine&mdash;three hundred and forty-nine years in
all&mdash;before the birth of their respective sons. This places
the deluge in the year of the world 1307.</p>
<p>(2.) <i>Genealogy from Noah to Abraham.</i> Chap. 11. Here the
Samaritan-Hebrew and the Septuagint (which Josephus follows with
some variations) give a much longer period than the Masoretic text.
They both add to the age of each of the six patriarchs after Shem
one hundred years before the birth of his son. To the age of Nahor
the Samaritan-Hebrew adds fifty, and the Septuagint one hundred and
fifty years. The latter also inserts after Arphaxad a <i>Cainan</i>
who was one hundred and thirty years old at the birth of Salah.</p>
<p>In respect to the variations in these two genealogical tables
(chaps. 5 and 11) it is to be remarked: (1) that the authority of
the Masoretic text is, on general grounds, higher than that of the
Septuagint or Samaritan Pentateuch; (2) that in the present case
there is reason to suspect systematic change in these two latter
texts; strong external corroboration alone could warrant us in
adopting the longer chronology of the Septuagint; (3) that any
uncertainty which may rest on the details of numbers in the
Pentateuch ought not to affect our confidence in the Mosaic record
as a whole, for here, as it is well known, there is a peculiar
liability to variations. With these brief remarks we must dismiss
this subject. The reader will find the question of scriptural
chronology discussed at large in the treatises devoted to the
subject. For more compendious views, see in Alexander's Kitto and
Smith's Dictionary of the Bible the articles entitled
Chronology.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II. EXODUS.</h3>
<p>7. The Hebrew name of this book is: <i>Ve-elle shemoth</i>,
<i>Now these</i> [are] <i>the names</i>; or more briefly:
<i>Shemoth</i>, <i>names</i>. The <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page232" id="page232"></a>{232}</span> word <i>Exodus</i> (Greek
<i>Exodos</i>, whence the Latin <i>Exodus</i>) signifies <i>going
forth</i>, <i>departure</i>, namely, of Israel from Egypt. With the
book of Exodus begins the history of Israel <i>as a nation</i>. It
has perfect unity of plan and steady progress from beginning to
end. The narrative of the golden calf is no exception; for this
records in its true order an interruption of the divine
legislation. The book consists of two parts essentially connected
with each other. The contents of the <i>first</i> part (chaps.
1-18) are briefly the <i>deliverance</i> of the Israelites from
Egypt and their <i>journey to Sinai</i>, as preparatory to their
national covenant with God there. More particularly this part
contains: (1) an account of the multiplication of the people in
Egypt; their oppression by the Egyptians; the birth and education
of Moses, his abortive attempt to interpose in behalf of his
people, his flight to Midian, and his residence there forty years
(chaps. 1, 2); (2) God's miraculous appearance to Moses at Horeb
under the name JEHOVAH; his mission to Pharaoh for the release of
Israel, in which Aaron his brother was associated with him; the
execution of this mission, in the progress of which the Egyptians
were visited with a succession of plagues, ending in the death of
all the first-born of man and beast in Egypt; the final expulsion
of the people, and in connection with this the establishment of the
feast of the passover and the law respecting the first-born of man
and beast (chaps. 3-13); (3) the journey of the Israelites to the
Red sea under the guidance of a cloudy pillar; their passage
through it, with the overthrow of Pharaoh's host; the miraculous
supply of manna and of water; the fight with Amalek, and Jethro's
visit to Moses.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> part contains <i>the establishment of the
Mosaic economy with its tabernacle and priesthood</i>. At Sinai God
enters into a national covenant with the people, grounded on the
preceding Abrahamic covenant; promulgates in awful majesty the ten
commandments, which he afterwards writes on two tables of stone,
and adds a code of civil regulations. Chaps. 19-23. The covenant is
then written and solemnly ratified by the blood of sacrifices.
Chap. 24. After this follows a direction which <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>{233}</span> contains
in itself the whole idea of the sanctuary: "<i>Let them make me a
sanctuary; that I may dwell among them</i>." Chap. 25:8. The
remainder of the book is mainly occupied with the structure of the
tabernacle and its furniture, and the establishment of the
Levitical priesthood. Directions are given for the priestly
garments, and the mode of inauguration is prescribed; but the
inauguration itself belongs to the following book. The narrative is
interrupted by the sin of the people in the matter of the golden
calf, with the various incidents and precepts connected with it
(chaps. 32-34), and a repetition of the law of the Sabbath is
added. Chap. 31:12-17. The office, then, which the book of Exodus
holds in the Pentateuch is definite and clear.</p>
<p>8. With regard to the <i>time of the sojourn</i> in Egypt, two
opinions are held among biblical scholars. The words of God to
Abraham: "Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall
afflict them four hundred years," "but in the fourth generation
they shall come hither again" (Gen. 15:13, 16); and also the
statement of Moses: "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel
who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years" (Exod.
12:40), seem to imply that they spent four hundred and thirty years
<i>in Egypt</i> (a round number being put in the former passage for
the more exact specification of the latter). It has been thought,
also, that the vast increase of the people in Egypt&mdash;to six
hundred thousand men (Exod. 12:37), which shows that the whole
number of souls was over two millions&mdash;required a sojourn of
this length. On the other hand, the apostle Paul speaks of the law
as given "four hundred and thirty years <i>after</i>" <i>the
promise to Abraham</i>. Gal. 3:17. In this he follows the Jewish
chronology, which is also that of the Septuagint and Samaritan
Pentateuch, for they read in Exod. 12:40: "who dwelt in Egypt and
in the land of Canaan." The words, "in the land of Canaan," are
undoubtedly an added gloss; but the question still remains whether
they are not a correct gloss. The genealogy of Levi's family (Exod.
6:16-20) <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id=
"page234"></a>{234}</span> decidedly favors the interpretation,
which divides the period of four hundred and thirty years between
Egypt and the land of Canaan. To make this table consistent with a
sojourn of four hundred and thirty years in Egypt, it would be
necessary to assume, with some, that it is an <i>epitome</i>, not a
full list, which does not seem probable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we can draw any certain argument from the increase of the
people in Egypt, we must know the <i>basis of calculation</i>. It
certainly includes not only the seventy male members of Jacob's
family, with their wives and children, but also the families of
their male-servants (circumcised according to the law, Gen. 17:12,
13, and therefore incorporated with the covenant people). From the
notices contained in Genesis, we learn that the families of the
patriarchs were very numerous. Gen. 14:14; 26:14; 32:10; 36:6, 7.
If Abraham was able to arm three hundred and eighteen "trained
servants born in his own house," how large an aggregate may we
reasonably assume for the servants connected with Jacob's family,
now increased to seventy male souls? We must not think of Jacob
going into Egypt as a humble personage. He was a rich and
prosperous <i>emir</i>, with his children and grandchildren, and a
great train of servants. With the special blessing of God upon his
children and all connected with them, we need find no insuperable
difficulty in their increase to the number mentioned at the
exodus.</p>
<p>Provision was made in a miraculous way for the sustenance of the
Israelites in the wilderness. The question has been raised: How
were their flocks and herds provided for? In answer to this, the
following remarks are in point: (1.) We are not to understand the
word "wilderness" of an absolutely desolate region. It affords
pasturage in patches. Robinson describes Wady Feiran, northwest of
Sinai, as well watered, with gardens of fruit and palm trees; and
he was assured by the Arabs that in rainy seasons grass springs up
over the whole face of the desert. The whole northeastern part of
the wilderness, where the Israelites seem to have dwelt much of the
thirty-eight years, is capable of cultivation, and is still
cultivated by the Arabs in patches. (2.) The Israelites undoubtedly
marched not in a direct line, but from pasture to pasture, as the
modern Arabs do, and spreading themselves out over the adjacent
region. When Moses besought his father-in-law not to leave him, but
to go with him that he might be to the people instead of eyes
(Numb. 10:31), we may well suppose that he had in view Hobab's
knowledge of the places where water and pasturage were to be found.
(3.) There is decisive evidence that this region was once better
watered than it is now, and more fruitful. The planks of
acacia-wood, the shittim-wood, which were employed in the
construction <span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id=
"page235"></a>{235}</span> of the tabernacle, were a cubit and a
half in width; that is, in English measure, something more than two
and a half feet. No acacia-trees of this size are now found in that
region. The cutting away of the primitive forests seems to have
been followed, as elsewhere, by a decrease in the amount of rain.
But, however this may be, we know that, for some reason, this part
of Arabia was once more fertile and populous. In its northeastern
part are extensive ruins of former habitations, and enclosed
fields. The same is true of the region around Beersheba and south
of it. Here Robinson found ruins of former cities, as Eboda and
Elusa. Of the latter place he says: "Once, as we judged upon the
spot, this must have been a city of not less than twelve or fifteen
thousand inhabitants. Now, it is a perfect field of ruins, a scene
of unutterable desolation; across which the passing stranger can
with difficulty find his way." Vol. 1, p. 197. And of Eboda,
farther south: "The large church marks a numerous Christian
population." "But the desert has resumed its rights; the intrusive
hand of cultivation has been driven back; the race that dwelt here
have perished; and their works now look abroad in loneliness and
silence over the mighty waste." Vol. 1, p. 194. Ritter, the most
accomplished of modern geographers, affirms that from the present
number of the thin and negligent population, we can draw no certain
conclusion respecting the former condition of the country.

<p>Of the numerous objections urged by Colenso against the
Pentateuch, and the book of Exodus in particular, many are
imaginary, and vanish upon the fair interpretation of the passages
in question. Others, again, rest on false assumptions in regard to
facts. For the details, the reader is referred to the works written
in reply.</p>

<h3>III. LEVITICUS.</h3>
<p>9. The Hebrews call this book <i>Vayyikra</i>, <i>and</i> [God]
<i>called</i>. Later Jewish designations are, <i>the law of
priests</i>, and <i>the law of offerings</i>. The Latin name
<i>Leviticus</i> (from the Greek <i>Leuitikon</i>, <i>Levitical,
pertaining to the Levites</i>) indicates that its contents relate
to the duties of the Levites, in which body are included all the
priests. The book of Leviticus is immediately connected with that
which precedes, and follows in the most natural order. The
tabernacle having been reared up and its furniture arranged, <i>the
services pertaining to it</i> are next ordained, and in connection
with these, various regulations, most of which come within the
sphere of the priestly office. Hence we have (1) the law for the
various offerings, followed by an account of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span> anointing
of the tabernacle, and the consecration of Aaron and his sons to
the priestly office, with the death of Nadab and Abihu for offering
strange fire before the Lord (chaps. 1-10); (2) precepts concerning
clean and unclean beasts, and cleanness and uncleanness in men from
whatever source, followed by directions for the annual hallowing of
the sanctuary on the great day of atonement, and also in respect to
the place where animals must be slain, and the disposition to be
made of their blood (chaps. 11-17); (3) laws against sundry crimes,
which admitted, in general, of no expiation, but must be visited
with the penalty of the law (chaps. 18-20); (4) various ordinances
pertaining to the purity of the priestly office, the character of
the sacrifices, the yearly festivals, the arrangements for the
sanctuary, etc., with the law for the sabbatical year and the year
of jubilee (chaps. 22-26:2); (5) a wonderful prophetic chapter,
announcing for all coming ages the blessings that should follow
obedience, and the curses which disobedience should bring upon the
people (chap. 26:3-46). There is added, as a sort of appendix, a
chapter concerning vows and tithes. Chap. 27.</p>
<p>10. The priestly office, with its sacrifices, was the central
part of the Mosaic economy, for it prefigured Christ our great High
Priest, with his all-perfect sacrifice on Calvary for the sins of
the world. On this great theme much remains to be said in another
place. It is sufficient to remark here that the book of Leviticus
gives the divine view of expiation. If the expiations of the
Levitical law were typical, the types were true figures of the
great Antitype, which is Jesus Christ, "the Lamb of God. which
taketh away the sin of the world." No view of his death can be true
which makes these types empty and unmeaning.</p>
<h3>IV. NUMBERS.</h3>
<p>11. <i>Bemidhbar</i>, <i>in the wilderness</i>, is the Hebrew
name of this book, taken from the fifth word in the original. It is
also called from the first word <i>Vayyedhabber</i>, <i>and</i>
[God] <i>spake</i>. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id=
"page237"></a>{237}</span> English version, after the example of
the Latin, translates the Greek name <i>Arithmoi</i>,
<i>numbers</i>, a title derived from the numbering of the people at
Sinai, with which the book opens, and which is repeated on the
plains of Moab. Chap. 26. This book records <i>the journeyings of
the Israelites from Sinai to the borders of the promised land</i>,
and their sojourn in the wilderness of Arabia, with the <i>various
incidents</i> that befell them, and the <i>new ordinances</i> that
were from time to time added, as occasion required. It embraces a
period of thirty-eight years, and its contents are necessarily of a
very miscellaneous character. The unity of the book is
<i>chronological</i>, history and legislation alternating with each
other in the order of time. A full enumeration of the numerous
incidents which it records, and of the new ordinances from time to
time enacted, is not necessary. In the history of these
thirty-eight years we notice three salient points or epochs. <i>The
first</i> is that of the <i>departure from Sinai</i>. Of the
preparations for this, with the order of the march and whatever
pertained to it, a full account is given. Then follow the incidents
of the journey to the wilderness of Paran, with some additional
laws. Chaps. 1-12. The <i>second</i> epoch is that of the rebellion
of the people upon the report of the twelve spies whom Moses had
sent to search out the land, for which sin the whole generation
that came out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, was
rejected and doomed to perish in the wilderness. Chaps. 13, 14.
This was in the second year of the exodus. Of the events that
followed to the thirty-eighth year of the exodus, we have only a
brief notice. With the exception of the punishment of the
Sabbath-breaker, Korah's rebellion and the history connected with
it, and also a few laws (chaps. 15-19), this period is passed by in
silence. The nation was under the divine rebuke, and could fulfil
its part in the plan of God only by dying for its sins with an
unrecorded history. The <i>third</i> epoch begins with the second
arrival of Israel at Kadesh, and this is crowded with great
events&mdash;the death of Miriam, the exclusion of Moses and Aaron
from the promised land, with the death of the latter at Mount Hor,
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id=
"page238"></a>{238}</span> refusal of Edom to allow a passage
through his territory, the wearisome journey of the people "to
compass the land of Edom," with their sins and sufferings, the
conquest of Arad, Sihon, and Og, and thus the arrival of the people
at the plains of Moab opposite Jericho. Chaps. 20-22:1. Then
follows the history of Balaam and his prophecies, the idolatry and
punishment of the people, a second numbering of the people, the
appointment of Joshua as the leader of the people, the conquest of
the Midianites, the division of the region beyond Jordan to the
tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and a
review of the journeyings of the people. With all this are
intermingled various additional ordinances.</p>
<h3>V. DEUTERONOMY.</h3>
<p>12. The Jewish name of this book is <i>Elle haddebharim</i>,
<i>these are the words</i>. The Greek name <i>Deuteronomion</i>,
whence the Latin <i>Deuteronomium</i> and the English
<i>Deuteronomy</i>, signifies <i>second</i> law, or <i>repetition
of the law</i>, as it is also called by the later Jews. The book
consists of discourses delivered by Moses to Israel in the plains
of Moab over against Jericho, in the eleventh month of the fortieth
year of the exodus. Deut. 1:1, 3. The peculiar character of this
book and its relation to the preceding books have been already
considered in the first part of the present work (Chap. 9, No. 10),
to which the reader is referred. It is generally divided into three
parts. The <i>first</i> is mainly a recapitulation of the past
history of Israel under Moses, with appropriate warnings and
exhortations, followed by a notice of the appointment of three
cities of refuge on the east side of Jordan. Chaps. 1-4. The second
discourse begins with a restatement of the law given on Sinai.
Exhortations to hearty obedience follow, which are full of fatherly
love and tenderness. Various precepts of the law are then added,
with some modifications and additions, such as the altered
circumstances of the people required. Chaps. 5-26. In the
<i>third</i> part the blessings and the curses of the law are
prominently set forth as motives to obedience. Chaps. 27-30. The
remainder of the book is occupied <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page239" id="page239"></a>{239}</span> with Moses' charge to
Joshua, his direction for depositing the law in the sanctuary by
the side of the ark, his song written by divine direction, his
blessing upon the twelve tribes, and the account of his death and
burial on mount Nebo.</p>
<p>13. As the book of Genesis constitutes a suitable
<i>introduction</i> to the Pentateuch, without which its very
existence, as a part of the divine plan, would be unintelligible,
so does the book of Deuteronomy bring it to a sublime close. From
the goodness and faithfulness of God, from his special favor
bestowed upon Israel, from the excellence of his service, from the
glorious rewards of obedience and the terrible penalties of
disobedience, it draws motives for a deep and evangelical
obedience&mdash;an obedience of the spirit and not of the letter
only. Thus it adds the corner-stone to the whole system of
legislation, completing it on the side of the motives by which it
challenges obedience, and investing it with radiant glory. The
Pentateuch, then, is a whole. The first book is inseparable from it
as an <i>introduction</i>; the last as a <i>close</i>. The three
intermediate books contain the legislation itself, and in this each
of them has its appropriate province.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id=
"page240"></a>{240}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>THE HISTORICAL BOOKS.</h3>
<p>1. In the Pentateuch we have the establishment of the Theocracy,
with the preparatory and accompanying history pertaining to it. The
province of the historical books is to <i>unfold its practiced
working</i>, and to show how, under the divine superintendence and
guidance, it accomplished the end for which it was given. They
contain, therefore, primarily, a history of God's dealings with the
covenant people under the economy which he had imposed upon them.
They look at the course of human events on the divine rather than
the human side, and in this respect they differ widely from all
other historical writings. Human histories abound with the endless
details of court intrigues, of alliances and wars, of material
civilization and progress, and whatever else pertains to the
welfare of men considered simply as the inhabitants of this world.
But the historical books of the Old Testament, written by
prophetical men illumined by the Holy Spirit, unfold with wonderful
clearness the mighty movements of God's providence, by which the
divine plan proposed in the Mosaic economy was steadily carried
forward, alike through outward prosperity and adversity, towards
the fulfilment of its high office. After a long series of bloody
struggles, the Theocracy attained to its zenith of outward power
and splendor under David and Solomon. From that time onward the
power of the Israelitish people declined, till they were at last
deprived of their national independence, and subjected to the yoke
of foreign conquerors. But in both the growth of the national power
under the Theocracy, and its decline, the presence of God and his
supremacy, as well over the covenant people as over the surrounding
nations, were gloriously manifested, and their training for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id=
"page241"></a>{241}</span> future advent of the Messiah was
steadily carried forward. Thus we have in these historical books a
wonderful diversity of divine manifestations, which alike charm and
instruct the pious mind.</p>
<p>2. It has already been shown (Chap. 15, No. 7) that the books of
Kings and Chronicles contain only <i>selections</i> from a large
mass of materials. The same is probably true of the books of Judges
and Samuel. The sacred writers did not propose to give a detailed
account of all the events belonging to the periods over which their
histories extended, but only of those which were specially adapted
to manifest God's presence and guidance in the affairs of the
covenant people. The history of some persons is given very fully;
of others with extreme brevity. But we may say, in general, that
this divine history, extending over a period of a thousand years,
is the most condensed in the world, as well as the most luminous
with the divine glory. The student rises from the perusal of it
with such clear views of God's presence and supremacy in the course
of human affairs, as cannot be gained from all the ponderous tomes
of secular history. Each book, moreover, presents some special
phase of God's providential movements, and contains, therefore, its
special lessons of instruction. With few exceptions, the
<i>authors</i> of the historical books are unknown. We only know
that they were prophetical men, who wrote under the illumination
and guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>I. JOSHUA.</h3>
<p>3. This book records the <i>conquest of the land of Canaan</i>
by the Israelites under Joshua, and its <i>distribution by lot</i>
among the tribes that received their inheritance on the west side
of the Jordan. It connects itself, therefore, immediately with the
Pentateuch; for it shows how God fulfilled his promise to Abraham
that he would give to his posterity the land of Canaan for an
inheritance (Gen. 17:8), a promise often repeated afterwards, and
kept constantly in view in the whole series of Mosaic legislation.
The book naturally falls into two parts. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>{242}</span> The
<i>first</i> twelve chapters contain the history of the conquest
itself, with the movements preparatory thereto. Joshua, who had
been previously designated as the leader of the people (Numb.
27:15-23), receives a solemn charge to pass over the Jordan and
take possession of the promised land; the people prepare themselves
accordingly; two spies are sent out to take a survey of Jericho;
the Israelites pass over the Jordan dry-shod, its waters having
been miraculously divided; they encamp at Gilgal, and are there
subjected to the rite of circumcision. Chaps. 1-5. Then follows an
account of the overthrow of Jericho, the trespass of Achan with the
calamity which it brought upon the people, the conquest of Ai, the
ratification of the law at mount Ebal with the erection of the
stones on which the law was written, the artifice of the Gibeonites
by which they saved their lives, the overthrow of the combined
kings of the Canaanites at Gibeon, and the conquest, first of the
southern and afterwards of the northern kings of Canaan. Chaps.
6-12.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> part gives an account of the division of the
land by lot among the several tribes. This work was begun as is
described in chapters 13-17, and after an interruption through the
dilatoriness of the people, for which Joshua rebuked them, was
continued and completed at Shiloh. Chaps. 18, 19. Six cities of
refuge were then appointed, three on each side of the Jordan;
forty-eight cities were assigned by lot to the Levites; and the two
and a half tribes that had received their inheritance on the east
side of the Jordan (Numb., chap. 32) were sent home. Chaps. 20-22.
The twenty-third chapter contains Joshua's charge to the elders of
Israel, and the twenty-fourth his final charge at Shechem to the
assembled tribes, on which occasion there was a solemn renewal of
the national covenant. The whole book is brought to a close by a
brief notice of the death of Joshua and Eleazar, and the interment
of the bones of Joseph in Shechem. This brief survey of the
contents of the book reveals at once its unity, its orderly plan,
and the place which it holds in the history of the Theocracy.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id=
"page243"></a>{243}</span>
<p>4. The <i>authorship</i> of the book cannot be determined from
the title alone, any more than that of the two books which bear the
name of Samuel. Jewish tradition ascribes it to Joshua himself,
except the last five verses. But it records some transactions
which, according to the most obvious interpretation of them,
occurred after Joshua's death. Among these are the conquest of
Hebron (chap. 15:16-19, compared with Judges 1:12-15), and
especially the excursion of the Danites (chap. 19:47), which must
be regarded as identical with that described in the eighteenth
chapter of the book of Judges. Unless we assume that this notice of
the Danites is an addition made by a later hand, we must suppose
that the book was written by some unknown prophetical man after
Joshua's death. He may well have been one of the elders who
overlived Joshua, since at the time of his writing Rahab was yet
living among the Israelites. Chap. 6:25.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The eighteenth chapter of the book of Judges, which records the
invasion of the Danites, is evidently an <i>appendix</i>,
introduced by the words: "In those days there was no king in
Israel;" and that this invasion took place not long after the
settlement of the people in Canaan, is manifest from the object
proposed by it. Judges 18:1. At the time of the conquest, Rahab was
a young woman, and may well have survived that event forty years or
more. The only apparent indication of a still later composition of
the book is that found in the reference to the book of
<i>Jasher</i>, chap. 10:13. From 2 Sam. 1:18, we learn (according
to the most approved interpretation of the passage) that David's
elegy on the death of Saul and Jonathan was written in the book of
Jasher. But we are not warranted in affirming that this title was
applied to a book of definitely determined contents. It may have
been a collection of national songs, enlarged from age to age.</p>
<p>Though Joshua does not appear to have been the author of the
book in its present form, we may well suppose that the writer
employed, in part at least, materials that came from Joshua's pen.
When the land was divided by lot among the several tribes, the
boundaries of each inheritance, with the cities pertaining to it,
must have been carefully described in writing by Joshua himself, or
by persons acting under his direction. It is probable that these
descriptions were copied by the author of the book of Joshua; and
this is sufficient to account for any diversity of diction that may
exist in this part of the book as compared with the purely historic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id=
"page244"></a>{244}</span> parts. Nothing in the style and diction
of this book, or in that of the two following books of Judges and
Ruth, indicates that they belong to a later age of Hebrew
literature. Certain peculiarities of expression which occasionally
appear in them may be naturally explained as provincialisms, or as
belonging to the language of conversation and common life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. The book of Joshua bears every internal mark of
<i>authent&iacute;city</i> and <i>credibility</i>. The main
transaction which it records&mdash;the extirpation of the
Canaanites by the immediate help of Jehovah, and the gift of their
country to the Israelites&mdash;was contemplated from the very
first by the Abrahamic covenant (Gen. 13:14, 15; 15:18-21; 17:8,
etc.), and also by the entire body of the Mosaic laws. Why God
chose to accomplish this by the sword of his covenant people, has
been already sufficiently considered. Chap. 10, No. 7. The
stupendous miracles recorded in the book of Joshua are in harmony
with the entire plan of redemption, the great and decisive
movements of which have been especially marked by signal
manifestations of God's presence and power. The man who denies the
credibility of this book on the ground of these miracles, must, for
consistency's sake, go much farther, and deny altogether the
supernatural manifestations of God recorded in the Bible, including
the mission, miraculous works, resurrection, and ascension of our
Lord Jesus Christ himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In chap. 10:12-14 we read that, at the word of Joshua, the sun
stood still and the moon stayed in the midst of heaven about a
whole day, so that "there was no day like that before it or after
it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man." Some have
sought to explain the whole passage as a quotation from "the book
of Jasher" expressed in the language of poetic hyperbole; and they
have compared with it such poetic amplifications as those contained
in Psa. 18:7-16; Hab., chap. 3, etc. But this interpretation is
forced and unnatural; and besides this, there remains the analogous
event of which we have a double record in 2 Kings 20:8-11; Isa. 38:
7, 8, and which is expressly ascribed to divine power: "Behold, I
will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in
the sun-dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward." Here it is manifest
that to human vision the sun, and with it the shadow, went backward
ten degrees. <i>How</i> this was accomplished we need not attempt
to determine. We are not shut up to the supposition that the earth
was turned back on her axis <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
id="page245"></a>{245}</span> ten degrees, nor that the rays of the
sun were miraculously deflected ten degrees (which would change his
apparent position in the heavens ten degrees), nor to any other
particular hypothesis. If God chose that the sun should to human
vision go backward ten degrees, he could accomplish it by means
inscrutable to us; and so also if he chose that it should stand
still in the midst of heaven about a whole day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II. JUDGES AND RUTH.</h3>
<p>6. The book of Judges is so called because it is occupied with
the history of the Israelites during the period when they were
under the general administration of <i>Judges</i>. These men are
not to be confounded with the ordinary judges under the Theocracy,
of the appointment of which we have an account in Exodus, chap. 18.
They were men specially raised up by God and endowed by him with
extraordinary qualifications for their office, which was general
and political rather than municipal. Many of them were military
leaders, called to their work in times of national calamity. In
times of peace they stood at the head of public affairs, although
with regard to some of them it is generally thought that their
jurisdiction extended to only a part of the Israelitish people.
Thus Jephthah and the three succeeding judges seem to have
exercised their office in northeastern Israel, while the scene of
Samson's exploits was southwestern Israel, and he was, in the
opinion of many, contemporary with Eli, who judged Israel at
Shiloh. The condition of the nation during the period of the Judges
is described as one in which "there was no king in Israel." Chap.
18:1; 19:1. There was no regularly organized central power which
could give unity to the movements of the people. The tribes seem to
have acted in a great measure independently of each other, as in
the expedition of the Danites. Chap. 18. It was only on special
occasions, like that of the sin and punishment of the Benjamites
(chaps. 19-21), that there was a general concert among them. This
state of affairs was not favorable to the development of the
military power of the nation, but it was well suited to the high
moral and religious ends which the Theocracy had in view; for it
compelled the people to feel <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page246" id="page246"></a>{246}</span> their constant dependence
on God's presence and help for defence against their enemies. Sin,
and oppression by the surrounding nations; repentance, and
deliverance by God's immediate interposition&mdash;this is the
oft-repeated story of the book of Judges. All this was in
accordance with the promises and threatenings of the Law, and it
illustrated alike the perverseness of the nation and God's
faithfulness in the fulfilment of his covenant. The incidents
recorded in this book are of a peculiarly checkered character, and
many of them are full of romantic interest. In the history of
redemption, the book of Judges has a well-defined place. It unfolds
to our view the operation of the Theocracy in the first stage of
the nation's existence, and under its first outward form of
government.</p>
<p>7. As it respects the <i>arrangement of materials</i>, the book
of Judges opens with a two-fold <i>introduction</i>, giving, first,
a brief notice of the wars carried on against the Canaanites by
certain tribes after Joshua's death, of the failure of the people
to effect a complete extirpation of the Canaanites, and of the
reproof administered to them by an angel of the Lord (chap. 1-2:5);
secondly, a survey of the course of events during the time of the
judges, with especial reference to God's faithfulness in the
fulfilment of his promises and threatenings. Chap. 2:6-3:6. Then
follows the <i>body of the work</i>, giving an account of the
<i>seven servitudes</i> to which the people were subjected for
their sins, and of the judges raised up by God for their
deliverance, with some incidental notices, as the history of
Abimelech, (chap. 9) and the quarrel of the men of Ephraim with
Jephthah. Chap. 12:1-6. The book closes with a two-fold
<i>appendix</i>, recording, first, the conquest of Laish by the
Danites, and in connection with this the story of Micah and his
idolatrous establishment (chaps. 17, 18); secondly, the punishment
of the Benjamites for espousing the cause of the wicked men of
Gibeah (chaps. 19-21). These events are not to be conceived of as
subsequent to those recorded in the body of the book, but as
contemporaneous with them.</p>
<p>8. The remark: "In those days there was no king in Israel"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id=
"page247"></a>{247}</span> (chaps. 18:1; 19:1) plainly implies that
the <i>date</i> of the book of Judges must be assigned to a period
after the establishment of the kingdom. The statement, on the other
hand, that the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
from Jerusalem, "but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day" (chap. 1:21), limits the time
of its composition to the period before David's conquest of the
city. 2 Sam. 5:6-9. The author of the book is unknown. Jewish
tradition ascribes it to Samuel. It may well have been written
during his life, and possibly under his supervision, though on this
point we can affirm nothing positively. The writer must have
availed himself of earlier written documents. See Chap. 15, No.
5.</p>
<p>9. The <i>chronology</i> of the book of Judges is a matter of
debate among biblical scholars. Some contend for a longer period,
in accordance with the reckoning of the apostle Paul, who says that
after God had divided to the people the land of Canaan by lot, "he
gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty
years, until Samuel the prophet." Acts 13:20. Others seek to reduce
the period so as to bring it into harmony with the statement in 1
Kings 6:1, that Solomon began to build the temple "in the four
hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come
out of the land of Egypt."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we suppose that the oppression of the Israelites by the
Philistines, described in the beginning of the first book of
Samuel, is the same as the forty years' oppression mentioned in the
book of Judges, and that the judgeship of Samson falls within the
same period (Judges 15:20), it is easy to make out the four hundred
and fifty years of the apostle's reckoning. From the beginning of
the first servitude under Cushan-rishathaim to the close of the
last under the Philistines, we have, reckoning the years of
servitude and rest in succession, and allowing three years for the
reign of Abimelech, three hundred and ninety years. For the
remaining sixty years we have (1) the time from the division of the
land by lot to the death of the elders who overlived Joshua; (2)
the time from the close of the last servitude to the establishment
of the kingdom; and possibly (3) a further period for Shamgar's
judgeship, though it is more probable that this falls within the
eighty years of rest after the oppression of the Moabites. Those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id=
"page248"></a>{248}</span> who adopt a shorter chronology, assume
that the forty years' dominion of the Philistines was
contemporaneous with the oppression of the northeastern tribes by
the Ammonites and the period during which Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon,
and Abdon judged Israel; their jurisdiction being, as they suppose,
restricted to the northeastern part of the land. For both the
longer and shorter chronology, there are several variously modified
schemes, the details of which the student can find in works devoted
to the subject of biblical chronology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>10. The incidents of the <i>book of Ruth</i> belong to the
period of the Judges, so that it may be regarded as in some sort an
appendix to the book of Judges, though probably not written by the
same author. It contains a beautiful sketch of domestic life in the
early period of the Theocracy, written with charming simplicity and
graphic vividness. Yet it is not on this ground alone or chiefly
that it has a place in the sacred canon. It records also the
sublime faith of Ruth the Moabitess, which led her to forsake her
own country and kindred to trust under the wings of the Lord God of
Israel (ch. 2:12), and which was rewarded by her being made the
ancestress of David and of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus the book
connects itself immediately with "the house and lineage of David,"
and may be regarded as supplementary to the history of his family.
It was evidently written after David was established on the throne.
Further than this we have no certain knowledge respecting its date;
nor can its author be determined.</p>
<h3>III. THE BOOKS OF SAMUEL.</h3>
<p>11. The two books of Samuel constituted originally one work. The
division was made by the Greek translators as a matter of
convenience, so as to close the first book with the death of Saul,
and begin the second with David's accession to the throne. This
division was followed by the Vulgate, and was introduced by Daniel
Bomberg into the printed Hebrew text. To the original whole work
the name of Samuel was appropriately given; for he is not only the
central personage in the history which it records to the
establishment of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id=
"page249"></a>{249}</span> kingdom, but it was also through him, as
the acknowledged prophet of the Theocracy, that both Saul and David
were designated and anointed for the kingly office. The Greek
Septuagint designates these books from their contents, <i>First and
Second</i> of <i>the Kingdoms</i>, and the Vulgate, <i>First and
Second of Kings</i>.</p>
<p>12. In the history of the plan of redemption these two books
have a well-defined province. They are occupied with <i>the
establishment</i>, under God's direction and guidance, <i>of the
kingly form of government</i> in the Theocracy. All the events
recorded before the inauguration of Saul were preparatory to that
event and explanatory of it. Since, moreover, Saul was afterwards
rejected with his family on account of his disobedience, and David
and his family were chosen in his stead, it was in the person of
David that the kingdom was first fully established, and with the
close of his reign the work accordingly ends. The period included
in this history, though comparatively brief, was most eventful.
Samuel, himself one of the greatest of the prophets, established a
school of the prophets, and from his day onward the prophetical
order assumed an importance and permanency in the Theocracy that
was before unknown. See above, Ch. 15, No. 11. The change to the
kingly form of government constituted a new era in the Hebrew
commonwealth. Although the motives which led the people to desire a
king were low and unworthy, being grounded in worldliness and
unbelief, yet God, for the accomplishment of his own purposes, was
pleased to grant their request. The adumbration in the Theocracy of
the kingly office of the future Messiah, not less than of his
priestly and prophetical office, was originally contemplated in its
establishment; and now the full time for this had come. While David
and his successors on the throne were true civil and military
leaders in a secular and earthly sense, their headship over God's
people also shadowed forth the higher headship of the long promised
Redeemer, the great Antitype in whom all the types contained in the
Mosaic economy find at once their explanation and their fulfilment.
Under David the Hebrew commonwealth was rescued from the oppression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id=
"page250"></a>{250}</span> of the surrounding nations, and speedily
attained to its zenith of outward power and splendor.</p>
<p>13. The <i>contents</i> of the books of Samuel naturally fall
under three main divisions. The <i>introductory</i> part takes up
the history of the commonwealth under Eli and continues it to the
time when the people demanded of Samuel a king. 1 Sam. chaps. 1-7.
This period properly belongs to that of the judges, but its history
is given here because of its intimate connection with the events
that follow. It describes the birth and education of Samuel; the
disorders that prevailed under Eli's administration, for which God
denounced upon his family severe judgments; the invasion of the
land by the Philistines, with the capture and restoration of the
ark; Samuel's administration, and the deliverance of the people
under him from the oppression of the Philistines. The <i>second</i>
part, extending through the remainder of the first book, opens with
an account of the abuses which led the people to desire a king, and
then gives an account of the selection, anointing, and inauguration
of Saul as king of Israel, with a notice of his exploit in
delivering the people of Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites. Chaps
8-12. It then gives an account of his first sin at Gilgal, for
which Samuel threatened him with the loss of his kingdom, and of
his victory over the Philistines, with a general summary of the
events of his reign. Chaps. 13, 14. For his second sin in the
matter of the Amalekites Saul is rejected, and David is anointed by
Samuel as his successor; the Spirit of the Lord forsakes Saul, and
an evil spirit from God troubles him; David becomes his minstrel,
is in high favor with him, slays Goliath in the presence of the two
armies of Israel and the Philistines, returns in triumph to the
camp of Saul, marries Michal his daughter, but becomes an object of
his jealousy and hatred because he has supplanted him in the
affections of the people. Chaps. 15-18:9. The remainder of the
first book is mainly occupied with an account of the persecutions
to which David was subjected on the part of Saul, and of the
wonderful way in which God delivered him. It closes with an account
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id=
"page251"></a>{251}</span> Saul's distress through the invasion of
the Philistines, of his resort in trouble to a woman that had a
familiar spirit, of the terrible message that he received at the
lips of the risen Samuel, of the defeat of the armies of Israel by
the Philistines, and of the death of Saul and his three sons on
Mount Gilboa. The <i>third</i> part occupies the whole of the
second book. It records the reign of David, first at Hebron over
the tribe of Judah, with the accompanying war between the house of
Saul and the house of David, and then, after Ishbosheth's death,
over all Israel at Jerusalem. With the fidelity of truth the sacred
historian describes not only David's many victories over the
enemies of Israel, but also his grievous sin in the matter of
Uriah, with the terrible chastisements that it brought upon him and
his kingdom&mdash;Amnon's incest, the murder of Amnon by Absalom,
Absalom's rebellion, pollution of his father's concubines, and
death in battle. The closing years of David's reign were saddened
also by David's sin in numbering the people, for which there fell
in pestilence seventy thousand of his subjects.</p>
<p>14. For the evidence that the author of these books availed
himself of the writings of the prophets contemporary with the
events described, see above, Chap. 15, No. 6. In 1 Chron. 29:29 we
read: "Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold they
are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer." If, as some
think, our present books of Samuel were composed shortly after
David's death, the author may well have been one of the last two of
the above-named prophets; but there are some indications that he
lived after the division of the Israelitish people into the two
kingdoms of <i>Judah</i> and <i>Israel</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1 Sam. 27:6 we read that Achish gave Ziklag to David;
"wheretofore," adds the sacred historian, "Ziklag pertaineth unto
the kings of Judah unto this day." The only natural interpretation
of these words is that the kings of Judah&mdash;not any particular
king of Judah, but the kings of Judah as a line&mdash;are named in
contrast with the kings of Israel. In <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>{252}</span> several
other passages, where he is speaking of events that occurred
<i>before</i> the separation of the two kingdoms, he puts Judah and
Israel together. 1 Sam. 11:8; 17:52; 18:16; 2 Sam. 3:10; 24:1. But
this can, perhaps, be explained from the fact that during the seven
years of David's reign at Hebron there was an actual separation of
Judah from the other tribes. It is a remarkable fact that while the
full term of David's reign is given (2 Sam. 5:4, 5), which implies
that the writer lived after its close, no notice is taken of his
death. The reason of this omission cannot be known. As the first
book of Kings opens with an account of David's last days and death,
some have conjectured that it was designedly omitted from the books
of Samuel as superfluous, when the historical books were arranged
in the sacred canon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>IV. THE BOOKS OF KINGS.</h3>
<p>15. These two books, like the two of Samuel, originally
constituted a single work. The division was first made by the Greek
translators, was followed by the Vulgate, and was finally admitted
by Daniel Bomberg into the printed Hebrew text. The Greek version
of the Seventy and the Latin version, having called the books of
Samuel, the former, First and Second of the Kingdoms, the latter,
First and Second of the Kings, designate these books as Third and
Fourth of the Kingdoms or Kings. Each of the historical books
presents the covenant people under a new aspect, and imparts new
lessons of instruction. In the book of Joshua we see them taking
triumphant possession of the promised land through the mighty
assistance of Jehovah; the book of Judges describes the course of
affairs in the Hebrew commonwealth before the existence of a
central kingly government; in the books of Samuel we learn how such
a central government was established, and how under the reign of
David the nation was raised from the deep degradation of servitude
to the summit of worldly power. But the Theocracy was only a
preparatory, and therefore a temporary form of God's visible
earthly kingdom. From the days of David and Solomon it began to
decline in outward power and splendor, and it is with the history
of this decline that the books of Kings are occupied. In the view
which they present of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"
id="page253"></a>{253}</span> divine plan they are in perfect
harmony with the preceding books of Samuel; but in respect to the
manner of execution they differ widely. The books of Samuel give
the history of Samuel, Saul, and David, with great fulness of
detail, and never refer the reader to other sources of information.
The books of Kings, on the contrary, give professedly only certain
portions of the history of the people under the successive kings,
always adding, at the close of each monarch's reign after Solomon,
that the rest of his acts may be found, for the kings of Judah, in
"the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah;" and, for the
kings of Israel, in "the book of the Chronicles of the kings of
Israel." The Chronicles referred to are not our present books of
Chronicles, as has been already shown, Chap. 15, No. 8, but a
larger collection of writings, from which the authors both of the
books of Kings and Chronicles drew materials, in part at least, for
their respective works. The history contained in the books of Kings
may be conveniently divided into three periods&mdash;(1) the reign
of Solomon over all Israel; (2) the history of the coexisting
kingdoms of Judah and Israel; (3) the history of the kingdom of
Judah after the extinction of the kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>16. The history of the <i>first</i> period opens with the reign
of Solomon, which excelled that of David in outward magnificence,
as it did that of every succeeding king. 1 Kings 3:13. The great
event of his reign, constituting an epoch in the history of the
Theocracy, was the <i>erection of the temple</i> on Mount Moriah,
which took the place of the ancient tabernacle constructed by
divine direction in the wilderness. Thus Solomon added to the
public services of the sanctuary an outward splendor and dignity
corresponding with the increased wealth and glory of the nation.
But in the case of his kingdom, as often elsewhere, the zenith of
magnificence came after the zenith of true power. Had his profuse
expenditures ceased with the erection of the temple and his own
house, it would have been well; but the maintenance of such a
household as his, embracing "seven hundred wives, princesses, and
three hundred <span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id=
"page254"></a>{254}</span> concubines," corrupted his religion and
that of the nation, burdened the people with heavy taxes, and thus
prepared the way for the division of his kingdom that followed
immediately after his death, as recorded in 1 Kings 12.</p>
<p>17. With the division of Solomon's kingdom under his son
Rehoboam into two hostile nations begins the <i>second</i> period
of the history. This division was brought about by God's
appointment as a chastisement for Solomon's sins, and in it the
national power received a blow from which it never recovered. The
religious effect also was unspeakably calamitous so far as the
kingdom of the ten tribes was concerned; for Jeroboam, the first
king of Israel, established idolatry <i>as a matter of state
policy</i>, thus corrupting the religion of his whole kingdom with
a view to the establishment of his own power, a sin in which he was
followed by every one of his successors. The sacred historian
carries forward the history of these two kingdoms together with
wonderful brevity and power. Sometimes, as in the days of Elijah
and Elisha, the history of the ten tribes assumes the greater
prominence, because it furnishes the fuller illustrations of God's
presence and power; but as a general fact it is kept in
subordination to that of Judah. It is a sad record of wicked
dynasties, each established in blood and ending in blood, until the
overthrow of the kingdom by the Assyrians about two hundred and
fifty-four years after its establishment. Meanwhile there was in
Judah an alternation of pious with idolatrous kings, and a
corresponding struggle between the true religion and the idolatry
of the surrounding nations, which the sacred writer also describes
briefly but vividly.</p>
<p>18. It was during the reign of the good king Hezekiah that the
extinction of the kingdom of Israel took place, and the
<i>third</i> period of the history began. Hezekiah's efforts for
the restoration of the true religion were vigorous and for the time
successful. But after his death the nation relapsed again into
idolatry and wickedness. The efforts of Josiah, the only pious
monarch that occupied the throne after Hezekiah, could not avail to
stay the progress of national degeneracy, and the kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id=
"page255"></a>{255}</span> of Judah was, in its turn, overthrown by
the Chaldeans, and the people carried captive to Babylon.</p>
<p>19. The <i>chronology</i> of certain parts of the history
embraced in the books of Kings is perplexed and uncertain. But the
beginning of the Babylonish captivity is generally placed B.C. 588,
three hundred and eighty-seven years after the beginning of
Rehoboam's reign, and one hundred and thirty-three years after the
extinction of the kingdom of Israel. Reckoning in the forty years
of Solomon's reign, we have for the period included in the books of
Kings to the beginning of the captivity four hundred and
twenty-seven years. To this must be added twenty-six more years for
the thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's captivity (2 Kings 25:27),
the last date given by the sacred historian. The <i>author</i> of
the books of Kings is unknown. Jewish tradition ascribes them to
Jeremiah, perhaps on the ground that the last chapter of Jeremiah
is mostly a repetition of 2 Kings from chap. 24:18 to the end of
the book. But Jeremiah and the author of these books may both have
made use of common documents. We only know that the writer lived
after the accession of Evil-merodach to the throne of Babylon (2
Kings 25:27), and during the full pressure of the Babylonish
captivity, since he nowhere gives any intimation of its approaching
close.</p>
<h3>V. THE BOOKS OF CHRONICLES.</h3>
<p>20. These books, which originally constituted a single work, are
called by the Hebrews: <i>Words of the Days</i>; that is,
<i>History of the Events of the Times</i>, or <i>Chronicles</i>, as
they were first called by Jerome. The Greek name
<i>Paraleipomena</i>, <i>things omitted</i>, has its ground in the
false supposition that they were designed to be supplementary to
the books of Kings, whereas they constitute an independent work
having its own plan and end. The author of the books of Kings
doubtless looked forward to the future restoration of his nation;
but the time for that joyous event was yet distant, and he could
have no immediate reference to the wants of the returning exiles.
His aim <span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id=
"page256"></a>{256}</span> was simply to set forth the course of
events under the Theocracy from Solomon to the captivity as an
illustration of God's faithfulness in the fulfilment of both his
promises and his threatenings. But the author of the books of
Chronicles wrote, as all agree, during the process of the
restoration. In addition to the common aim of all the historical
writers, he had a particular object in view, which was to furnish
the restored captives with such information as would be especially
interesting and important to them, engaged as they were in the
re&euml;stablishment of the commonwealth. Hence we may naturally
explain the peculiarities of these books as compared with the books
of Kings.</p>
<p>(1.) The writer gives <i>particular attention to the matter of
genealogy</i>. The first nine chapters are occupied with
genealogical tables interspersed with short historical notices,
which the author took, for the most part at least, from documents
that have long since perished. To the returning exiles the lineage
of their ancestors must have been a matter of general interest. A
knowledge of the descent of the families of the different tribes
would greatly facilitate the people in regaining their former
inheritances. To the priests and Levites, especially, it was of the
highest importance that they should be able to show their lineage,
since upon this depended their right to minister in holy things.
Ezra 2:61-63.</p>
<p>(2.) The books of Chronicles are very <i>full on all that
pertains to the temple service</i>. The writer devotes, for
example, eight chapters to an account of David's preparations for
the erection of the temple, and of his elaborate arrangements for
all the different parts of the service pertaining to the sanctuary.
1 Chron. chaps. 22-29. He gives a particular description of the
solemn covenant made by the people with Jehovah under Asa's
direction, 2 Chron. 15:1-15; of the reformatory labors and faith of
Jehoshaphat, 2 Chron. 19, 20; of Hezekiah, 2 Chron. chaps. 29-31;
and he adds to the account of Josiah's efforts against the
idolatrous practices of his day, a notice of his solemn observance
of the passover, 2 Chron. 35:1-19.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id=
"page257"></a>{257}</span>
<p>(3.) He <i>omits</i>, on the other hand, <i>the history of the
kingdom of Israel</i>, giving only a notice of its establishment,
and of certain parts of its history which were connected with that
of the kingdom of Judah. The apparent ground of this is, that the
kingdom of the ten tribes furnished no example which could be
available to the people in the work of re&euml;stablishing the
commonwealth. It is to be noticed, moreover, that he passes over in
silence the adultery of David with its calamitous consequences, and
the idolatry of Solomon. This is, perhaps, due to the brevity of
the history before the division of the kingdom; for he does not
spare the sins of the pious monarchs that followed. See 2 Chron.
16:7-12; 19:2; 32:25, 31; 35:21, 22.</p>
<p>21. In the Hebrew canon the books of Chronicles stand last in
order. It is generally agreed that they were written, after the
return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, <i>by Ezra</i>,
who had all the qualifications for such a work. Whatever use he may
have made of the earlier books of Samuel and Kings, it is plain
that these were not his chief sources, for he records many things
not found in them. He and the author of the books of Kings had
access to the same public records, and each of them made such
selections from them as suited his purposes. Hence the matter
contained in the two works agrees in part, and is partly different.
See above, Chap. 15, Nos. 7, 8.</p>
<p>22. That there are some discrepancies between the books of
Samuel and Kings and the books of Chronicles, arising from errors
in transcribing, is generally admitted. These relate, however,
mainly to dates, and do not affect the general integrity of the
works. But most of the disagreements between the earlier and later
histories are only apparent, arising from their brevity, and from
the fact that their authors frequently select from the same reign
different events, the one passing by in silence what the other
records; or that, where they record the same events, various
accompanying circumstances are omitted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of apparent error in transcription is 2 Sam. 24:13
compared with 1 Chron. 21:12; the former passage specifying
<i>seven</i> years of famine, the latter <i>three</i> years. For
other examples see 2 Sam. 8:4 compared <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>{258}</span> with 1
Chron. 18:4; 2 Sam. 23:8 with 1 Chron. 11:11; 1 Kings 4:26 with 2
Chron. 9:25. We are not to infer, however, that all cases of
apparent disagreement involve error in one or the other of the
records. When the events of a whole campaign, for example, are
crowded into single sentences, it is not surprising that the
different narratives should contain seeming discrepancies which a
full knowledge of the details would enable us to reconcile. The
separate discussion of the difficulties presented by the books of
Chronicles, as compared with the earlier histories, belongs to the
commentator. It is sufficient to remark here, that independent
parallel histories always exhibit, with substantial agreement,
minor diversities which it is sometimes not easy to harmonize. It
has not pleased God that in this respect the sacred narratives of
either the Old or the New Testament should constitute an exception
to the general rule. The parallel narratives of our Lord's life
contain as many and as great diversities as those of the old Hebrew
commonwealth. Though we may not always be able to show how these
are to be brought into harmony, they constitute no valid objection
to the authenticity of the histories in the one case any more than
in the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>VI. EZRA AND NEHEMIAH.</h3>
<p>23. In the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which record the most
important events connected with the <i>restoration of the Hebrew
commonwealth</i>, we have unfolded to our view a new era in the
history of the Theocracy. The contrast between the relation of the
Israelitish people to the heathen world in the days of Joshua, and
of Ezra and Nehemiah is as great as possible. Under Joshua the
people marched, sword in hand, as invincible conquerors, to the
possession of the promised land, while the hearts of their enemies
melted before them. After the captivity they returned in weakness
and fear, by the permission of their heathen rulers and under their
patronage and protection. But in the latter case, not less than in
the former, the Theocracy was steadily advancing under God's
guidance towards the accomplishment of its high end, which was the
preparation of the Jewish people, and through them the world, for
the advent of the promised Messiah. In the beginning of the Mosaic
economy, and during the earlier part of its course, it was
altogether appropriate that God should make stupendous supernatural
manifestations of his infinite perfections and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>{259}</span> of his
supreme power over the nations of the world. Thus he revealed
himself as the only living and true God in the sight of all men.
But as the history of the covenant people went forward, there was a
gradual return to the ordinary providential administration of the
divine government. God's miraculous interventions were never made
for mere display. They always had in view a high religious end. As
that end approached its accomplishment, they were more and more
withdrawn, and soon after the captivity they ceased altogether
until the final and perfect manifestation of God in Christ. From
Malachi to Christ was the last stage of the Theocracy, when, in the
language of the New Testament, it was waxing old and ready to
vanish away. Heb. 8:13. It was neither needful nor proper that its
history should be dignified by such displays of God's miraculous
power as marked its earlier periods.</p>
<p>24. But, although the age of miracles ceased after the
Babylonish captivity, the Theocracy went steadily forward in the
accomplishment of its divine mission. In truth it was now that it
secured for the first time, as a permanent result, the high end
proposed by it from the beginning, that of rescuing a whole nation
from idolatrous practices and making it steadfast in the worship of
the true God, at least so far as the outward life is concerned. By
the permanent subjection of the Jewish people to heathen rulers,
their national pride was humbled, and they were placed in such a
relation to heathenism as inclined them to abhor rather than
imitate its rites. The fulfilment of the terrible threatenings
contained in the law of Moses in the complete overthrow, first of
the kingdom of Israel, and afterwards of that of Judah, and their
long and bitter bondage in Babylon, administered to them severe but
salutary lessons of instruction, under the influence of which they
were, by God's blessing, finally reclaimed from idolatrous
practices. In connection with the restoration, the synagogue
service was established, in which the law and the prophets were
regularly read and expounded to the people throughout the land. To
this, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id=
"page260"></a>{260}</span> more than to any other human
instrumentality, was due that steadfastness which the Jewish people
ever afterwards manifested in the worship of the true God. Thus,
while the outward glory of the Theocracy declined, it continued to
accomplish the true spiritual end for which it was established.</p>
<p>25. The book of <i>Ezra</i> embraces a period of about
seventy-nine years, from the accession of Cyrus to the throne of
Persia to the close of Ezra's administration, or at least to the
last transaction under it of which we have a record. The first six
chapters give a brief sketch of the course of events among the
restored captives before Ezra's arrival at Jerusalem, especially
their activity in rebuilding the temple, the formidable opposition
which they encountered from the neighboring people, and how that
opposition was finally overcome. The last four chapters contain the
history of Ezra's administration, the chief event of which was the
putting away by the princes and people of the heathen wives whom
they had married. That Ezra was the author of this book is
generally acknowledged. The first three verses are a repetition,
with some unessential variations, of the last two verses of
Chronicles, of which he is also believed, on good grounds, to have
been the author. In certain passages he speaks of himself in the
third person; Ch. 7:1-26; ch. 10; but there is no reason to deny,
on this ground, that he was their author. Jeremiah changes, in like
manner, employing sometimes the first and sometimes the third
person. Certain parts of this book, which are mainly occupied with
public documents respecting the building of the temple and the
orderly arrangement of its services, are written in the Chaldee
language, namely: chaps. 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In respect to the Persian monarchs mentioned in this and the two
following books, there is not an entire agreement among biblical
scholars. The following table, formed in accordance with the views
that seem to be best supported, will be useful to the reader. It
contains, arranged in three parallel columns, first the names of
the Persian kings in their order of succession, as given by profane
historians; secondly, their scriptural names; thirdly, the dates of
their accession to the throne, according to the received
chronology.</p>

<p>26. The book of <i>Nehemiah</i> continues the history of the
Jewish people after the restoration, beginning with the commission
which Nehemiah received from Artaxerxes Longimanus, king of Persia,
in the twentieth year of his reign (B.C. 446), to go to Jerusalem
in the capacity of Tirshatha, or civil governor, for the purpose of
rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and setting in order the affairs
of the commonwealth. The book naturally falls into three divisions.
The <i>first</i> division contains the history of his labors in
rebuilding the walls of the city and putting an end to the practice
of usury, and of the violent opposition and intrigues of the
surrounding people. Chaps. 1-7:4. To this is appended a
genealogical list, which is the same for substance as that
contained in the second chapter of Ezra. Ch. 7:5-73.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon a comparison of the two catalogues, we find various
differences in respect to names and numbers. The differences of
names may be explained from the fact that it was common for men to
bear different titles, particularly if they were persons of
distinction; as, for example, Daniel and Belteshazzar, Zerubbabel
and Sheshbazzar. It is not certain upon what principle the
differences in numbers are to be explained. The sum total of both
catalogues is the same, namely, 42,360; from which it is plain that
the lists are in both cases partial, since neither of them amounts
to this sum. We add the following suggestion from Grey's Key as
quoted by Scott: "The sum of the numbers, as separately detailed,
will correspond, if to the 29,818 specified by Ezra, we add the
1,765 persons reckoned by Nehemiah which Ezra has omitted; and, on
the other hand, to the 31,089 enumerated by Nehemiah, add the 494,
which is an overplus in Ezra, not noticed by Nehemiah; both writers
including in the sum total 10,777 of the mixed multitude, not
particularized in the individual detail."</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id=
"page262"></a>{262}</span>
<p>In the <i>second</i> division we have an account of the solemn
public reading of the law of Moses at the feast of tabernacles,
and, in connection with this, of the renewal of the national
covenant with Jehovah through the signature and seal of the
princes, Levites, and priests, in their own behalf and that of the
people. Chaps. 8-10. In this religious and ecclesiastical
transaction, Ezra the priest was the leader; Nehemiah, as the
Tirshatha, or civil governor, simply taking the lead of the princes
in the act of sealing.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> division contains, along with some genealogical
lists, an account of the measures taken by Nehemiah and the princes
to increase the number of residents in Jerusalem, of the solemn
dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, and of the rectification of
various abuses which had crept in partly during Nehemiah's absence
at the court of Persia. Chaps. 11-13.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date of Nehemiah's commission to rebuild the walls of
Jerusalem is important on account of its connection with the
seventy prophetic weeks of Daniel, which are reckoned "from the
going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem."
Dan. 9:25. It cannot be considered as exactly ascertained, but may
be placed somewhere from B.C. 454 to B.C. 446. See the commentators
on Dan. 9:24-27. How long Nehemiah's administration continued after
his visit to the court of Persia, in the twelfth year of his rule,
is not known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>27. The book, as its title testifies, was written by Nehemiah,
not earlier than his return from the court of Persia (ch. 13:6;
5:14); how much later cannot be known. From the general character
of style and diction which belongs to the second division (chaps.
8-10), as well as from the absence of Nehemiah's peculiar forms of
speech, some have thought that Ezra, as the chief actor in the
reading of the law and renewal of the national covenant, wrote the
account of the transaction, and that Nehemiah incorporated it into
his work. To this supposition there is no serious objection. We
must remember, however, that arguments based on supposed
differences of style cannot amount to much where the materials from
which a conclusion is to be drawn are so scanty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id=
"page263"></a>{263}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>The genealogical notice in ch. 12:10, 11, which gives the
lineage of the high priests from Joshua to Jaddua, who is
apparently the high priest described by Josephus as having met
Alexander the Great on his march to Jerusalem, is thought by many
to be an addition made after Nehemiah's death as a matter of public
interest. See above, Chap. 15, No. 17. The same judgment is passed
by some on 1 Chron. 3:19-24. But the interpretation of this latter
passage is very uncertain.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>VII. ESTHER.</h3>
<p>28. This book, the author of which is unknown, records the
wonderful manner in which the plot of Haman the Agagite to destroy
the Jews was not only overthrown, but turned to their enlargement
and honor. It is remarkable that the author refrains throughout
from mentioning the name of God, although he manifestly designs to
represent this deliverance as effected by his providence, and that
too in answer to the fervent prayers of the Jews in connection with
a fast of three days' continuance. He prefers, as it would seem, to
let the facts speak for themselves. The book closes with an account
of the establishment, under the auspices of Mordecai and Esther, of
the feast of Purim, in commemoration of the deliverance which it
records; and we are perhaps warranted in saying that the immediate
occasion of writing the book was to show the historic origin of
that festival&mdash;a festival mentioned in the second book of
Maccabees, under the title of <i>Mordecai's</i> day (chap. 15:36),
and observed, according to Josephus, by the Jews throughout the
whole world. Antiq., 11, 6. 13.</p>
<p>29. Among the various opinions respecting the Ahasuerus of this
book, the best sustained is that which identifies him with the
celebrated <i>Xerxes</i> of profane history. With this agrees all
that is said of the splendor and extent of his dominions, extending
"from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty
provinces" (1:1), and of his passionate, capricious, and sensual
character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To us, who are accustomed to a government of law, in which the
rulers are restrained from the exercise of arbitrary power, and are
kept under constant restraint by popular opinion, the incidents
recorded in this book <span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id=
"page264"></a>{264}</span> seem very strange. But it gives a true
and faithful portraiture of the course of affairs at the court of a
Persian despot, where the monarch knows no law but his own
arbitrary will, suddenly elevates his favorites to the highest
places of power and trust, as suddenly consigns them to the hand of
the executioner, and gives himself up to the unbridled indulgence
of his passions. The history of Haman's sudden rise and fall is
that of many an oriental courtier since his day. The Jews, we are
told, "slew of their foes seventy and five thousand." This was a
very great slaughter; but we must remember that it was distributed
through all the provinces of the kingdom. Ch. 9:16. The permission
which they had received was "in every city to gather themselves
together, and to stand for their life; to destroy, to slay, and to
cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that
would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the
spoil of them for a prey" (ch. 8:11); all which, except the last
clause, seems to have been carried into execution. We are not
required to vindicate the wisdom of this severe decree, or to deny
that the Jews may have used to excess the terrible power thus
conferred upon them. On the side of God's providence, the vengeance
that fell upon the Jews' enemies was righteous; but on the side of
the human instrumentalities employed by him, there may have been
much imperfection, or even folly and wickedness. So it has ever
been in the history of human affairs, and so it is at the present
day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>THE POETICAL BOOKS (INCLUDING ALSO ECCLESIASTES AND
CANTICLES).</h3>
<p>1. The Hebrews reckon but three books as <i>poetical</i>,
namely: Job, Psalms, and Proverbs, which are distinguished from the
rest by a stricter rhythm&mdash;the rhythm not of feet, but of
<i>clauses</i> (see below, No. 3)&mdash;and a peculiar system of
accentuation. It is obvious to every reader that the poetry of the
Old Testament, in the usual sense of the word, is not restricted to
these three books. But they are called poetical in a special and
technical sense. In any natural classification of the books of the
Old Testament, those of Ecclesiastes and Canticles will fall into
the division which contains the books of Job, Psalms, and
Proverbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hebrew system of accentuation is very subtle and
complicated, and there is nothing corresponding to it in our
western languages. These so-called accents are quite numerous, one
of them resting, as a general rule, upon each word. Certain of them
are peculiar to the poetical books, and are called poetical
accents. They serve a threefold office. (1.) They guide the
modulated flow of the voice in <i>cantillation</i>, thus serving,
in a certain sense, as <i>musical notes</i>. Some think that this
was their primary office. (2.) They indicate the <i>logical
relation</i> to each other of the words and clauses, thus
performing the office of marks of <i>interpunction</i>. (3.) They
rest, with certain exceptions, on the <i>tone</i> syllable, and
thus serve as <i>accents</i> in our restricted sense of the
word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first division of the present chapter, the
<i>characteristics of Hebrew poetry</i> will be briefly considered
in respect to its <i>spirit</i>, its <i>form</i>, and its
<i>offices</i>. Then will follow, in the second division, a notice
of the <i>contents of the several books</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id=
"page266"></a>{266}</span>
<h3>(A.) CHARACTERISTICS OF HEBREW POETRY.</h3>
<p>2. As it respects the <i>spirit</i> of Hebrew poetry, we notice,
first of all, its perfect <i>harmony with the spirit of the
Theocracy</i>. It is, in truth, an outgrowth of the Theocracy in
the souls of holy men educated under its influence and thoroughly
imbued with its spirit. The God of Moses and Aaron is also the God
of David, Asaph, and Solomon; of Hosea, Isaiah, and Habakkuk. In
his boldest flights the Hebrew poet always remains loyal to the
institutions of Moses, not in their letter alone, but much more in
their spirit, of which he is the inspired interpreter. The same
Jehovah who thundered from Sinai and spake to the people by Moses,
speaks also by the sweet psalmist of Israel, by the wisdom of
Solomon, and by the whole succession of the prophets. Hence the
poetry of the Hebrews is radiant throughout with the pure
monotheism of the Theocracy. It exhibits God in his infinite
perfections, as the Creator and sovereign Ruler of the world,
without a single taint of pantheism or polytheism, and that in an
age when pantheism and polytheism were the reigning forms of
religion without the pale of the covenant people.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing mark of Hebrew poetry is the <i>vivid
consciousness of God's presence</i> by which it is pervaded. In
this respect it runs entirely parallel with Hebrew history. It has
already been remarked (Ch. 20, No. 1) that Hebrew history differs
widely from all other historical writings in its habit of looking
at the course of human events from the Divine side, rather than the
human; that while secular history is mainly occupied with the
endless details of human combinations and alliances, and the
progress of material civilization, the historical books of the Old
Testament unfold to us with wonderful clearness God's presence and
power as shaping the course of human events in the interest of his
great plan of redemption. Take, for example, that small section of
Hebrew history comprehended under the title, <i>Affinity with
Ahab</i>. No Christian can read it without feelings of holy awe,
for it is radiant throughout <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page267" id="page267"></a>{267}</span> with the presence of that
righteous God who renders to every man according to his works, and
visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third
and fourth generation. In it the retributive justice of God shines
forth, like the lightning, from one end of heaven to the other.
Just so is Hebrew poetry also filled with the presence and glory of
God. When the Hebrew bard sweeps his lyre, all nature gives signs
of her Maker's presence. The heavens rejoice before him, the earth
is glad, the sea roars, the mountains and hills break forth into
singing, and all the trees of the field clap their hands. He looks
on the earth, and it trembles; he touches the hills, and they
smoke. Nor less conspicuous is his presence in providence and in
the human soul. He is seen in awful majesty high above the tumult
of the nations, directing their movements to the accomplishment of
his own infinitely wise purposes; making the wrath of man to praise
him, and restraining the remainder of it. Meanwhile his presence
shines in the believer's soul, like the sun in his strength,
filling it with strength, light, and gladness. In a word, over the
whole domain of Hebrew poesy, whether its theme be God or nature or
human society or the human spirit, is heard continually the solemn
cry of the seraphim: "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the
whole earth is full of his glory."</p>
<p><i>Originality</i> is another feature of Hebrew poetry. It
cannot indeed be said that this quality belongs to all the Hebrew
poets. With such divinely perfect models as the later writers had
before them, models with which they had been familiar from
childhood, it was natural that they should imitate them. The spirit
of inspiration did not prevent this, for it was not necessary to
the ends of revelation that it should be prevented. Set even among
the later poets we have some striking examples of originality; and
Hebrew poetry, taken as a whole, is original in the fullest sense
of the word, borrowing nothing that we know of from any other
nation. Not to anticipate the question of the age to which the book
of Job belongs, and passing by some gems of poetry contained in the
book of Genesis, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id=
"page268"></a>{268}</span> we may say that the oldest recorded song
of certain date which the world possesses is that of the Israelites
upon their deliverance at the Red sea. Exod., ch. 15. Next in order
(to pass by the poetic effusions of Balaam, and some other
fragments, Numb., chaps. 21-24) come the song which Moses wrote for
the children of Israel just before his death (Deut., ch. 32), and
(according to the title, the genuineness of which there is no valid
reason for doubting) "the prayer of Moses the man of God,"
contained in the ninetieth psalm. In the period of the judges we
have only the song of Deborah and Barak. The perfect originality of
all these primitive songs is acknowledged by all. It constitutes
indeed one of their chief charms. With "the sweet psalmist of
Israel" began the era of lyric song; with Solomon that of didactic,
and with Hosea, Joel, Isaiah, and their contemporaries, that of
prophetic poetry. The poets to whom, under the illumination of the
Holy Ghost, these different forms of Hebrew poetry owe their
origin, are all distinguished for their originality. So is also the
book of Job, that great didactic song so perfectly unique in its
character.</p>
<p>The wonderful <i>freshness and simplicity of thought</i> in
Hebrew poetry is inseparably connected with its originality. A
thought is fresh when it bursts forth directly from the inner
fountain of the soul just as it was conceived there. But the moment
the man pauses to remould it and shape it to some artificial
standard of propriety, it loses its originality and its freshness
together. It is no longer the living, glowing conception as it
existed in his bosom, but rather what he thinks it ought to have
been. In the process of working it over he has killed, if not its
life, at least its power. But the Hebrew poet opens, so to speak,
the floodgates of his heart, and pours forth the stream of his
thoughts and emotions just as they have sprung into being there.
Because he is under the sanctifying and illuminating influence of
the divine Spirit, they are high and holy thoughts. Because they
come forth in their primitive form, they are natural and fresh; and
for this reason the lapse of ages does not diminish their power
over the human spirit.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id=
"page269"></a>{269}</span>
<p>Intimately connected also with the originality of Hebrew poetry
is its charming <i>variety</i>. The Hebrew poets are exceedingly
unlike each other in native character, in training, in surrounding
circumstances, and in the nature of the work laid upon them by the
Spirit of inspiration. And as they all write in a natural and
appropriate way, it follows that their writings must exhibit great
diversities. No two writers can well be more unlike each other than
Isaiah and the author of the book of Job. With Isaiah the central
object of thought is always <i>Zion</i>, in whose interest he sees
God governing the world, and whose future glory is revealed to him
in prophetic vision. But Zion is not an individual. She is a divine
organization which God has destined to universal victory, and
around which revolve, under his almighty guidance, the great
movements of the heathen nations. The prophet, accordingly, has to
do not so much with particular persons, as with the destiny of
society, which is involved in that of Zion. He describes her
present conflicts and her future triumphs in his own peculiar and
gorgeous imagery. But the problem before the author of the book of
Job is <i>God's providence towards individuals</i>, as viewed from
the position of the Old Testament before the fuller revelations of
the New. He is occupied with the destiny of particular persons,
rather than of nations or of human society at large. To the
solution of the question of God's justice towards individual man he
directs all his energy, and he discusses this great theme in a
manner as effective as it is original. His imagery is as forcible
as that of Isaiah, but how different, and how powerfully adapted to
his end! A few passages from each of these great poets, set side by
side, will exhibit the contrast between them in a striking
manner.</p>

</tr>
</table>
<p>If now we open the book of Psalms, we find ourselves in a new
world of poetry, as different from that of Isaiah as it is from
that of the book of Job. David was anointed by God to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>{271}</span> be the
head and leader of Israel. As such he had a perpetual outward
conflict with powerful, crafty, and malicious foes, who sought his
life and his kingdom. This brought to him a perpetual inward
conflict with doubts and fears. Under the pressure of this double
conflict he penned those wonderful psalms, which are the embodiment
of his whole religious life. And since heart answers to heart, as
face to face in water, they are the embodiment of religious life in
all ages. The songs of David and his illustrious collaborators,
Asaph and the sons of Korah, are emphatically the poetry of
religious experience. As such they can never grow old. They are as
fresh to-day as when they were written. God has given them to his
church as a rich treasury for "the service of song in the house of
the Lord," in the family, and in the closet. If we turn from the
book of Psalms to the book of Proverbs, we have still another type
of poetry, unlike any one of the forms hitherto considered. It is
the poetry of <i>reflection</i> on the course of human life, as
seen in the light of God's law and God's providence. It is,
therefore, didactic in the highest sense of the word&mdash;the
poetry of practical life. The maxims of heavenly wisdom embodied in
the book of Proverbs will make all who study them, believe them,
and obey them, prosperous in this life and happy in the life to
come. This contrast between the great Hebrew poets might be carried
through the whole galaxy, but the above hints must suffice.</p>
<p><i>Diversity of themes</i> often coincides with difference in
the character of the poets. Where the theme is the same, each
writer will still pursue his own peculiar method. If that theme be
the vengeance of God on the wicked, the style will naturally be
rugged and abrupt. Yet the ruggedness and abruptness of David will
not be that of Hosea or Nahum. But where both the theme and the
character of the poet differ, there the diversity of style becomes
very striking. To illustrate this, take the two following
passages:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id=
"page272"></a>{272}</span>
<table cellspacing="10" summary="David and Nahum">

<td>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He
restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in
the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my
cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the
days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever. Psa. 23.</td>
<td>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
therein. Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in
the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
the rocks are thrown down by him. The Lord is good, a strong hold
in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. But
with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place
thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. Nahum 1:5-8.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The passage from Nahum is like a pent-up mountain stream leaping
from precipice to precipice. The psalm is like the same stream
escaped to the plain, and winding its way gently and placidly
through green meadows and shady groves vocal with the songs of
birds. This subject might be pursued to an indefinite extent.
Suffice it to say that Hebrew poetry has the charm of endless
variety, always with graceful adaptation to the nature of the
theme.</p>
<p>The <i>oriental imagery</i> in which Hebrew poetry abounds
imparts to it a peculiar and striking costume. Palestine was, in an
emphatic sense, the Hebrew poet's world. It was the land given by
God to his fathers for an everlasting possession; about which all
his warm affections clustered; with whose peculiar scenery and
climate, employments and associations, all his thoughts and
feelings had been blended from childhood. It followed of necessity
that these must all wear an oriental costume. As soon as he opens
his mouth there comes forth a stream of eastern imagery, very
natural and appropriate to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"
id="page273"></a>{273}</span> him, but much of it very strange to
us of these western regions. To understand the extent of this
characteristic one has only to peruse the Song of Solomon. The
bride is black but comely as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of
Solomon. She is a dove in the clefts of the rock; her hair is as a
flock of goats, that appear from Mount Gilead; her teeth are like a
flock of sheep which come from the washing; her lips are like a
thread of scarlet; her temples are like a piece of a pomegranate;
her stature is like a palm tree, and her breasts like clusters of
grapes&mdash;all thoroughly oriental. So also the bridegroom is
like a roe or a young hart leaping upon the mountains; his eyes are
as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters; his cheeks are as a
bed of spices; his lips like lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh,
and his countenance as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. So also if
we open the book of Isaiah, we find the Messiah described as "the
shadow of a great rock in a weary land"&mdash;a figure which could
not well occur to an Englishman or an American, but was perfectly
natural in the mouth of a Hebrew familiar with the terrible sun of
the Asiatic deserts, where neither tree nor cloud offers a shelter
to the thirsty and fainting traveller. Precisely here lies much of
the obscurity of which the expounders of Hebrew poetry complain.
True, there are other difficulties of a formidable character. The
theme is often vast, stretching into the distant and dimly-revealed
future; the language rugged with abrupt transitions, the historic
allusions obscure, and the meaning of the terms employed doubtful.
But aside from all these considerations the western scholar
encounters a perpetual difficulty in the fact that he is not of
oriental birth, and can enter but imperfectly into the spirit and
force of oriental imagery. What costs him days of laborious
investigation would open itself like a flash of lightning to his
apprehension&mdash;all except that which remains dark from the
nature of the prophetic themes&mdash;could he but have that perfect
apprehension of the language, the historic allusions, the imagery
employed, and the modes of thought, which was possessed by the
contemporaries of the Hebrew poet.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id=
"page274"></a>{274}</span>
<p>It remains that we notice in the last place what may be called
the <i>theocratic imagery</i> of the Hebrew poets; that is, imagery
borrowed from the institutions of the Mosaic law. The intense
loyalty of the Hebrew poets to the Mosaic law has already been
noticed. They were its divinely-appointed expositors and defenders,
and their whole religious life was moulded by it. No wonder, then,
that their writings abound with allusions to its rites and usages.
The sweet psalmist of Israel will abide in God's tabernacle for
ever, and trust in the covert of his wings, the literal tabernacle
on Zion representing God's spiritual presence here and his beatific
presence hereafter (Psa. 61:4 and elsewhere); he will have his
prayer set forth before God as incense, and the lifting up of his
hands as the evening sacrifice (Psa. 141:2); he will be purged with
hyssop that he may be clean, and washed that he may be whiter than
snow (Psa. 51: 7); he will offer to God the sacrifice of a broken
spirit (Psa. 51:17); the people promise to render to God the calves
of their lips (Hosea 14:2); the vengeance of God upon Edom is
described as "a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the
land of Idumea," in which the Lord's sword shall be filled with the
blood of lambs and goats and the fat of the kidneys of rams (Isa.
34: 6); with allusions to the Levitical sprinklings God promises
that he will sprinkle upon his penitent and restored people clean
water that they may be clean (Ezek. 36: 25); and with allusion to
the sacrificial flocks assembled at Jerusalem on the occasion of
her great festivals, that he will increase them with men like a
flock&mdash;"as the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her
solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of
men" (Ezek. 36:37, 38). How full the book of Psalms is of allusions
to the solemn songs of the sanctuary with their accompaniment of
psaltery and harp, trumpet and cornet, every reader understands.
This subject might be expanded indefinitely, but the above hints
must suffice.</p>
<p>3. We come now to the <i>form</i> of Hebrew poetry. This is
distinguished from the classic poetry of Greece and Rome, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id=
"page275"></a>{275}</span> well as from all modern poetry by the
absence of metrical feet. Its rhythm is that of <i>clauses</i>
which correspond to each other in a sort of free parallelism, as
was long ago shown by Bishop Lowth in his Prelections on the Sacred
Poetry of the Hebrews, the matter of which has been revised and
expanded in later treatises. Herein, as elsewhere, Hebrew poetry
asserts its originality and independence. Biblical scholars
recognize three fundamental forms of parallelism in Hebrew poetry,
which will be briefly considered, first separately, and then in
their combinations.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> is the <i>antithetic</i> form, where two
parallel members are contrasted in meaning, a form peculiarly
adapted to didactic poetry, and therefore occurring most abundantly
in the book of Proverbs. The following are examples of it:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The memory of the just is blessed:</p>
<p>But the name of the wicked shall rot (Prov. 10:7);</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>where, in the original Hebrew, each clause consists of three
words. In such an antithetic parallelism the words of one couplet,
at least, must correspond in meaning, as here <i>memory</i> and
<i>name</i>; while the others are in contrast&mdash;<i>just</i> and
<i>wicked</i>, <i>is blessed</i> and <i>shall rot</i>. Sometimes
the two clauses are to be mutually supplied from each other,
thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A wise son maketh a glad father:</p>
<p>But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother (Prov.
10:1);</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>where the reader understands that a wise son is the joy, and a
foolish son the grief of both father and mother.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> form is the <i>synonymous</i>, where the same
general thought is repeated in two or more clauses. It is found
abundantly in the whole range of Hebrew poetry, but is peculiarly
adapted to that which is of a placid and contemplative character.
Sometimes the parallel clauses simply repeat the same thought in
different words; in other cases there is only a general
resemblance. Examples are the following:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:</p>
<p>The Lord shall have them in derision. Psa. 2:4.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id=
"page276"></a>{276}</span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous:</p>
<p>With favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield. Psa.
5:12.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Perish the day wherein I was born;</p>
<p>And the night in which it was said, There is a man child
conceived.</p>
<p>Job 3:3.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom:</p>
<p>Give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. Isa.
1:10.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the following example we have a <i>compound</i> synonymous
couplet:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Give them according to their deeds,</p>
<p>According to the wickedness of their endeavors:</p>
<p>Give them after the work of their hands,</p>
<p>Render to them their desert. Psa. 28:4</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes three or more parallel clauses occur, thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When your fear cometh as desolation,</p>
<p>And your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;</p>
<p>When distress and anguish cometh upon you. Prov. 1:27.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;</p>
<p>Who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
<p>Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;</p>
<p>Who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;</p>
<p>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things;</p>
<p>Thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. Psa. 103:3-5.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the preceding example, synonymous parallelism passes into
<i>simple enumeration</i>. So often with a succession of short
clauses, or shorter and longer clauses, where the poetry of the
Hebrews assumes the freedom of prose, thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Who hath woe?</p>
<p>Who hath sorrow?</p>
<p>Who hath contentions?</p>
<p>Who hath babbling?</p>
<p>Who hath wounds without cause?</p>
<p>Who hath redness of eyes? Prov. 23:39.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>A sinful nation;</p>
<p>A people laden with iniquity;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id=
"page277"></a>{277}</span>
<p>A seed of evil-doers;</p>
<p>Corrupt children:</p>
<p>They have forsaken the Lord;</p>
<p>They have despised the Holy One of Israel;</p>
<p>They have gone away backward. Isa. 1:4.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The parallel clauses are frequently introduced or followed by a
single clause, thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Blessed is the man</p>
<p>Who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly;</p>
<p>And standeth not in the way of sinners;</p>
<p>And sitteth not in the seat of scorners. Psa. 1:1.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Hear, O heavens;</p>
<p>Give ear, O earth;</p>
<p>For the Lord hath spoken. Isa. 1:2.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>third</i> form of parallelism is called <i>synthetic</i>
(Greek <i>synthesis</i>, <i>a putting together</i>), where one
clause is necessary to complete the sense of the other, as in the
following examples:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,</p>
<p>Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. Prov. 15:16.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes;</p>
<p>But the Lord pondereth the hearts. Prov. 21:2.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Whoso curseth his father and his mother,</p>
<p>His lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. Prov. 20:20.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The connection between the two clauses may be that of
comparison, cause, effect, etc. Sometimes it is not expressed, but
simply implied, as in the following:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A whip for the horse,</p>
<p>A bridle for the ass,</p>
<p>And a rod for the fool's back. Prov. 26:3.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>combinations</i> of the above forms in Hebrew poetry are
exceedingly varied and graceful. Here are examples of two
<i>synonymous</i> couplets that are <i>antithetic</i> to each
other:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The ox knoweth his owner,</p>
<p>And the ass his master's crib:</p>
<p>Israel doth not know,</p>
<p>My people doth not consider. Isa. 1:3.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id=
"page278"></a>{278}</span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to naught;</p>
<p>He maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</p>
<p>The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever;</p>
<p>The thoughts of his heart to all generations. Psa. 33:10,
11.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the following example, two <i>synonymous</i> couplets
constitute together a <i>synthetic</i> parallelism:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Because they regard not the works of the Lord,</p>
<p>Nor the operation of his hands,</p>
<p>He shall destroy them,</p>
<p>And not build them up. Psa. 28:5.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the following, three <i>synthetic</i> parallelisms make a
<i>synonymous</i> triplet:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>For as the heaven is high above the earth,</p>
<p>So great is his mercy toward them that fear him:</p>
<p>As far as the east is from the west,</p>
<p>So far hath he removed our transgressions from us:</p>
<p>Like as a father pitieth his children,</p>
<p>So the Lord pitieth them that fear him. Psa. 103:11-13.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But our limits will not allow us to pursue this subject farther.
The freedom of the Hebrew poet is one of his high prerogatives. He
is not a slave to form, but uses form as it suits his purposes. He
blends together the different kinds of parallelism as he pleases.
Often he breaks through all parallelism to the freedom of prose.
But he soon returns again, because this measured rhythm of clauses
is to him the natural costume of poetic thought, which always seeks
to embody itself in some form of rhythm.</p>
<p>To the form of Hebrew poetry belongs also its <i>peculiar
diction</i>. To one who reads the Hebrew poets in the original,
this is a striking characteristic. He meets with words, and
sometimes with grammatical forms, that do not occur in the prose
writers. Many of these peculiar words are <i>Aramean</i>; that is,
they are words current in the Aramean branch of the Shemitic
languages. Chap. 14, No. 1. They are to be regarded as
<i>archaisms</i>&mdash;old words that were once common alike to the
Hebrew and the kindred Aramean, but which have been <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>{279}</span> dropped
out of prose usage in Hebrew. They must not be confounded, as has
too often been done, with <i>true Aramaisms</i>, that is, Aramean
words and forms borrowed by later Hebrew writers from their
intercourse with those who spoke Aramean.</p>
<p>4. As it respects the <i>office</i> of Hebrew poetry, it is
throughout subservient to the interests of revealed religion. This
is implied in what has been already said of the loyalty of the
Hebrew poets to the institutions of the Theocracy. It follows that
the poetry of the Bible is all <i>sacred</i> in its character. It
contains no examples of purely secular poetry except here and there
a short passage which comes in as a part of history; for example,
the words of "those that speak in proverbs," Numb. 21:27-30;
perhaps also the lament of David over Saul and Jonathan. 2 Sam.
1:19-27. It is certain that the song contained in the forty-fifth
psalm and that of the Canticles were received into the canon solely
on the ground that they celebrate the mutual love between God and
the covenant people, considered as his bride; or, in New Testament
language, between Christ and "the bride, the Lamb's wife."</p>
<p>But sacred poetry has various uses. One of its earliest offices
was to celebrate the praises of God for his interposition in behalf
of his covenant people, as in the song of the Israelites at the Red
sea, and that of Deborah and Barak. But when David was raised to
the throne of Israel, the time had now come for introducing lyric
poetry as a permanent part of the sanctuary service. God
accordingly bestowed upon this monarch the needful inward gifts,
and placed him in the appropriate outward circumstances; when at
once there gushed forth from his bosom, smit by the spirit of
inspiration, that noble stream of <i>lyric song</i>, which the
congregation of the faithful immediately consecrated to the public
service of the sanctuary, and which, augmented by the contributions
of Asaph, the sons of Korah, and other inspired poets, has been the
rich inheritance of the church ever since. In the book of Job,
sacred poetry occupies itself with the mighty problem of the
justice of God's providential government over men. It is,
therefore, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id=
"page280"></a>{280}</span> essentially <i>didactic</i> in its
character. In the Proverbs of Solomon, it becomes didactic in the
fullest sense; for here it moves in the sphere of practical life
and morals. The book of Ecclesiastes has for its theme the vanity
of this world, considered as a satisfying portion of the soul; and
this it discusses in a poetic form. Finally, the prophets of the
Old Testament exhaust all the wealth of Hebrew poetry in rebuking
the sins of the present time, foretelling the mighty judgments of
God upon the wicked, lamenting the present sorrows of Zion, and
portraying her future glories in connection with the advent of the
promised Messiah. The Hebrew harp&mdash;whoever sweeps it, and
whether its strains be jubilant or sad, didactic or emotional, is
ever consecrated to God and the cause of righteousness.</p>
<h3>(B.) THE SEVERAL POETICAL BOOKS.</h3>
<h4>I. JOB.</h4>
<p>5. The design of the book of Job will best appear if we first
take a brief survey of its plan. Job, a man eminent above all
others for his piety and uprightness, is accused by Satan as
serving God from mercenary motives. To show the falsehood of this
charge, God permits Satan to take from the patriarch his property
and his children, and afterwards to smite him with a loathsome and
distressing disease. Thus stripped of every thing that could make
life valuable, he still holds fast his integrity, and returns to
his wife, who counsels him to "curse God and die," the discreet and
pious answer: "Shall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and
shall we not receive evil?" His three friends, who have come to
comfort him, amazed and confounded at the greatness of his
calamities, sit down with him in silence for seven days. At last
Job opens his mouth with vehement expressions of grief and
impatience, and curses the day of his birth. The three friends
sharply rebuke him, and in a threefold round of addresses (only
that the third time Zophar fails to speak), enter into an earnest
controversy with him assuming the false ground that the
administration <span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id=
"page281"></a>{281}</span> of God's government over this world is
strictly <i>retributive</i>, so that special calamity comes only as
a punishment for special wickedness, and is therefore itself a
proof of such wickedness. They accordingly exhort him to repent of
his sins, and seek God's forgiveness, as the sure means of removing
his present misfortunes. Conscious of his integrity, Job, with much
warmth and asperity, repels their unjust charges, and refutes their
false arguments by an appeal to facts. The ground he takes is that,
by some inscrutable plan of God, calamity comes alike upon good and
bad men. He passionately beseeches God to show him why he thus
deals with him; and, according as faith or despondency prevails in
his soul, he sometimes expresses the hope that he shall come out of
his troubles like gold tried in the fire; and then, again, the fear
that he shall speedily sink down to the grave under the weight of
his sorrows, and nevermore see good. Having put to silence his
three friends by an array of facts to which they can make no reply,
he freely expresses the belief that the hypocrite's end shall be
destruction (chap. 27); shows that the wisdom by which God governs
the world is above man's comprehension, whose true wisdom lies in
fearing and obeying his Maker (chap. 28); contrasts his present
calamities with his former prosperity (chaps. 29, 30); and closes
with a solemn protestation of his integrity (chap. 31).</p>
<p>Elihu, a young man who has hitherto been a silent witness of the
controversy, now takes up the argument on the ground that trouble
is sent by God upon men as a <i>discipline</i>, that by it they may
be made aware of their errors and infirmities; and that, if they
make a right improvement of it, by bearing it with patient
submission and looking to God in penitence and prayer for its
removal, it will end in renewed and higher prosperity. To show the
unreasonableness of charging upon God injustice, he dwells at
length upon his infinite majesty and greatness. The special ground
of Job's trial, as given in the first two chapters, Elihu could not
of course understand. But his general position in regard to human
afflictions is right; and it should be carefully noticed that their
issue as described by him in the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page282" id="page282"></a>{282}</span> case of a good man&mdash;an
imperfectly good man under a system of grace&mdash;is precisely
what happens to Job when he humbles himself before his Maker.</p>
<p>As Elihu's discourse was drawing towards a close, the signs of
God's approach had already began to manifest themselves (chap. 37).
Now he addresses Job out of the whirlwind, rebuking him for his
presumptuous language, and setting before him His infinite
perfections, manifested in the creation and government of the
world, as a sufficient proof that to arraign His justice at the bar
of human reason is folly and presumption. Job now humbles himself
unconditionally before his Maker. Upon this God publicly justifies
him to his three friends, while He condemns them, declaring that he
has spoken of Him the thing which is right (42:8). This is to be
understood as referring not to the <i>spirit</i> manifested by Job,
which God had sharply rebuked, but rather to the <i>ground</i>
taken by him in respect to God's dealings with men. By God's
direction the three friends now offer sacrifices for their folly,
which are accepted in answer to Job's prayer in their behalf, and
his former prosperity is restored to him in double measure.</p>
<p>6. From the above sketch of the plan of the book its
<i>design</i> is manifest. It unfolds the nature of God's
providential government over men. It is not simply retributive, as
the three friends had maintained, so that the measure of a man's
outward sufferings is the measure of his sins; nor is it simply
incomprehensible, so that there can be no reasoning about it; but
it is disciplinary, in such a way that sorrow, though always the
fruit of sin, comes upon good men as well as upon the wicked, being
a fatherly chastisement intended for their benefit, and which, if
properly improved, will in the end conduct them to a higher degree
of holiness, and therefore of true prosperity and happiness. The
three friends were right in maintaining God's justice; but with
respect to the manner of its manifestation their error was
fundamental. Job's view was right, but inadequate. A disciplinary
government, administered over a world in which the wicked and the
imperfectly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id=
"page283"></a>{283}</span> good live together, must be
incomprehensible as it respects the particular distribution of good
and evil. Elihu was right in the main position, but he wanted
authority. The question was settled by God's interposition not
<i>before</i> the human discussion, nor <i>without</i> it, but
<i>after</i> it; an interposition in which the three friends were
condemned, Job approved, and the argument of Elihu left in its full
force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been the fashion with a certain class of critics to
disparage Elihu as a self-conceited young man, and to deny the
authenticity of his discourses. But thus the plan of the book is
fatally broken, as must be evident from the account given of it
above. It was not necessary that Elihu should be named in the
prologue. It is enough that he is described when he takes a part in
the argument. Why he is not named in the closing chapter has been
already indicated. There was nothing in his argument to be
censured. As to the attacks made on other parts of the book as not
authentic, for example, what is said of Behemoth and Leviathan,
they rest on no valid foundation. They are only judgments of modern
critics as to how and what the author of the book before us ought
to have written. The attempt to resolve into disconnected parts a
book so perfect in its plan, and which has come down to us by the
unanimous testimony of antiquity in its present form, is a most
uncritical procedure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. Job plainly belonged to the patriarchal period. This appears
from his longevity. He lived after his trial a hundred and forty
years (42:16), and must have been then considerably advanced in
life. This points to a period as early as that of Abraham. To the
same conclusion we are brought by the fact that no form of idolatry
is mentioned in the book, but only the worship of the heavenly
bodies. The simplicity of the patriarchal age appears, moreover, in
all its descriptions. But we need not from this infer that the book
was written in the patriarchal age, for the author may have
received from the past the facts which he records. The book is
written in pure Hebrew, with all the freedom of an original work,
and by one intimately acquainted with both Arabic and Egyptian
scenery. Some have supposed Moses to be the author, but this is
very uncertain. The prevailing opinion of the present day is that
it was written not far from the age of Solomon.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id=
"page284"></a>{284}</span>
<p>8. There is no ground for denying that the book of Job has a
foundation of <i>true history</i>. He is mentioned by Ezekiel with
Noah and Daniel as a real person. Ezek. 14:14, 20. The apostle
James also refers to the happy issue of his trials as a historic
event calculated to encourage God's suffering children. Jas. 5:11.
But we need not suppose that all the details of the book are
historic. The inspired poet takes up the great facts of Job's
history and the great arguments connected with them, and gives them
in his own language; probably also, to a certain extent, according
to his own arrangement. The scene of the first two chapters is laid
in heaven. Undoubtedly they record a real transaction; but it may
be a transaction revealed to the author in an allegorical form,
like Micaiah's vision (1 Kings 22:19-22), that it might be thus
made level to human apprehension.</p>
<h4>II. THE PSALMS.</h4>
<p>9. We have seen the office of the Book of Job in the system of
divine revelation. Very different, but not less important, is that
of the book of Psalms. It is a collection of sacred lyrics: that
is, of poems expressive of religious feeling and adapted to the
public worship of God. In respect to subjects, the Psalms exhibit a
wonderful diversity. They cover the whole field of religious
experience, and furnish to the churches an inexhaustible treasury
of sacred song for all ages. Seventy-three of the psalms are
ascribed to David in their titles, and the whole book, as referred
to in the New Testament, bears his name. Of the remaining psalms,
Asaph is named as the author of twelve; to the sons of Korah eleven
are ascribed; to Solomon two (Psalms 72 and 127); to Moses one
(Psalm 90); to Ethan one (Psalm 89). The remaining fifty are
anonymous. Of these, some appear from their contents to have been
written as late as the era of the captivity and restoration. Some
writers have referred certain psalms to the Maccabean age. But
there is nothing in the contents of these psalms which makes such a
reference necessary, and we have decisive evidence <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>{285}</span> that the
Hebrew canon was closed long before this period. See below, Chap.
22, No. 21.</p>
<p>10. In regard to the external arrangement of the Psalms, which
is generally ascribed to Ezra, and cannot be earlier than his day,
they are divided in the Hebrew Bible into <i>five books</i>, each
closing with a doxology except the last, to which, as well as to
the whole collection, the final psalm serves as a doxology.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> book contains Psalms 1-41. Of these forty-one
psalms, thirty-seven bear the name of David. Of the remaining four,
the second and tenth undoubtedly belong to him, and in all
probability the first and thirty-third also. The psalms of this
book are remarkable for the predominance of the name <i>Jehovah</i>
over <i>Elohim</i>, <i>God</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> book includes Psalms 42-72. Of these, eighteen
bear the name of David; the first eight (including Psa. 43, which
is manifestly connected with the preceding psalm) are ascribed to
the sons of Korah; one to Asaph (Psa. 50); one to Solomon (Psa.
72); and the remaining three are without titles. In this book the
divine name <i>Elohim</i>, <i>God</i>, greatly predominates over
the name <i>Jehovah</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> book includes Psalms 73-89, seventeen in all.
Of these, the first eleven are ascribed to Asaph; four to the sons
of Korah; one to David (Psa. 86); and one to Ethan the Ezrahite
(Psa. 89). In the psalms of Asaph the divine name <i>Elohim</i>,
<i>God</i>, predominates; in the remainder of the book the name
<i>Jehovah</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>fourth</i> book includes Psalms 90-106. Of these
seventeen psalms, only three bear titles; the ninetieth being
referred to Moses, the hundred and first and hundred and third to
David. This book is therefore emphatically one of anonymous psalms,
which are for the most part of a very general character, being
evidently arranged with reference to the service of song in the
sanctuary. Throughout this book the divine name <i>Jehovah</i>
prevails; the name <i>Elohim</i>, <i>God</i>, being rarely used
except in connection with a pronoun or some epithet&mdash;<i>my
God</i>, <i>God of Jacob</i>, etc.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id=
"page286"></a>{286}</span>
<p>The <i>fifth</i> book contains the remaining forty-four psalms.
Of these, fifteen are ascribed to David; one to Solomon (Psa. 127);
and twenty-eight are anonymous. In this book also the divine name
<i>Jehovah</i> prevails almost exclusively.</p>
<p>It is probable that these five books were arranged not
simultaneously but successively, with considerable intervals
between some of them. The subscription appended to the second book:
"The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended," may possibly be
explained, upon this supposition. It may have been added as a
subscription to the first two books, before the others were
arranged for the temple service.</p>
<p>Although the psalms belonging to the respective books are not
classified upon any strict principle, yet their arrangement is not
altogether fortuitous. We find psalms with the same title grouped
together&mdash;eleven psalms of Asaph. (73-83); eight of the sons
of Korah (42-49); eight of David (139-145 separated from his other
psalms); three psalms inscribed <i>Al-taschith</i> (57-59); the
fifteen songs of degrees (120-134), etc. Also we find psalms of
similar contents grouped together&mdash;Psa. 79, 80; 88, 89;
91-100; 105-107; etc.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made to classify the psalms according
to their subjects. But their very richness and variety makes this a
very difficult undertaking. They cover the whole field of religious
experience for both individual believers and the church at large.
Many of them&mdash;the so-called <i>Messianic</i> psalms&mdash;are
prophetic of the Saviour's offices and work. We need not wonder,
therefore, that the Psalms are quoted in the New Testament oftener
than any other book of the Old Testament, Isaiah not excepted.</p>
<p>11. Besides the names of the authors, or the occasion of their
composition, many of the psalms bear other inscriptions. Of these
the principal are the following:</p>
<p>(1.) The <i>dedicatory title: To the chief musician</i>,
prefixed to fifty-three psalms, signifies that the psalm is
assigned to him, as the leader of the choir at the tabernacle or
temple, to be used in the public worship of God. The title rendered
in our <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id=
"page287"></a>{287}</span> version: <i>For the sons of Korah</i>,
is better translated, as in the margin: <i>Of the sons of
Korah</i>; that is, written by one of their number.</p>
<p>(2.) Titles expressing the <i>character</i> of the composition.
Here we have, as the most common and general, <i>Psalm</i>, a lyric
poem to be sung; <i>Song</i>, a title borne by sixteen psalms,
generally in connection with the word <i>psalm</i>, where the
rendering should be: <i>a psalm</i>, <i>a song</i>; or, <i>a
song</i>, <i>a psalm</i>. All the psalms thus designated except two
(Psa. 83, 88) are of a joyous character, that is, songs of praise;
<i>Song of degrees</i>, a title the meaning of which is disputed.
Many render: <i>A song of ascents</i>, and suppose that the fifteen
psalms which bear this title (120-134) were so called because they
were arranged to be sung on the occasion of the ascent of the
people to Jerusalem to keep the yearly festivals. For other
explanations, the reader is referred to the commentaries. The
titles: <i>Prayer</i> (Psa. 17, 90, 102, 142), and <i>Praise</i>
(Psa. 145) need no explanation. Besides these titles, there are
several others left untranslated in our version, as:
<i>Maschil</i>, <i>teaching</i>, that is, a didactic psalm;
<i>Michtam</i> (Psa. 16, 56-60) either a <i>writing</i>, that is,
poem, or a <i>golden psalm</i>.</p>
<p>(3.) Titles relating to the <i>musical</i> performance. Of
these, the most common is the much disputed word <i>Selah</i>. It
is generally agreed that it signifies a <i>rest</i>, either in
singing for the purpose of an instrumental interlude, or an entire
rest in the performance. As a general rule, this title closes a
division of a psalm. Of the titles supposed to indicate either
musical instruments or modes of musical performance, the following
are examples: <i>Neginath</i> (Psa. 61), elsewhere <i>Neginoth</i>,
<i>stringed instruments</i>; <i>Nehiloth</i>, probably flutes (Psa.
5); <i>Gittith</i> (Psa. 8, 81, 84), from the word <i>Gath</i>,
which denotes a Philistine city, and also a wine-press. Gittith has
been accordingly interpreted to mean (1) a musical instrument or a
melody brought from Gath; (2) a musical instrument in the form of a
winepress, or a melody used in treading the wine-press;
<i>Shoshannim</i>, <i>lilies</i> (Psa. 45, 69);
<i>Shushan-eduth</i>, <i>lily of the testimony</i> (Psa. 60);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id=
"page288"></a>{288}</span> <i>Shoshannim-eduth</i>, <i>lilies of
the testimony</i> (Psa. 80), either a musical instrument so named
from its shape, or a particular melody, or, as some think, an
emblematic term referring to the contents of the psalm;
<i>Sheminith</i>, <i>the eighth</i>, or octave, perhaps a musical
key (Psa. 6, 12); <i>Alamoth</i>, <i>virgins</i>, probably denoting
treble voices (Psa. 46); <i>Al-taschith</i>, <i>destroy not</i>
(Psa. 57, 58, 59, 75), according to some, the name of an air taken
from a well-known poem; according to others, an indication of the
contents of the psalm. For other titles, occurring but once or
twice, the reader must be referred to the commentaries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the titles constitute a part of the psalms; that is,
whether they were prefixed by the writers themselves, is a question
that has been much debated, and answered differently by different
writers. That they are very ancient&mdash;so ancient that the
meaning of the terms employed had passed into oblivion when the
Alexandrine version was made&mdash;must be admitted. But it would
be too much to affirm that they are a part of the inspired word.
The correctness of some of them is doubtful. If we admit their
general correctness, reserving for critical investigation the
question of the historical validity of particular titles, it is as
far as we need go.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>III. THE PROVERBS OF SOLOMON.</h4>
<p>12. The <i>place</i> of the book of Proverbs in the system of
divine revelation is obvious at first sight. It contains a complete
code of practical rules for the regulation of life&mdash;rules that
have a divine breadth and fulness, and can make men wise not for
time alone, but also for eternity. The principles embodied in them
admit of endlessly varied applications, so that the study of a life
cannot exhaust them. The more they are pondered, and prayed over,
and reduced to practice, the more are their hidden treasures of
wisdom brought to light. Solomon lived himself in the sphere of
practical life. He had constantly to deal with men of all classes,
and he knew men and the course of human events most thoroughly. His
maxims are therefore adapted to the actual world, not to some
imaginary state of things; and they contain those broad principles
of action which meet the wants of all men in all circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id=
"page289"></a>{289}</span> and conditions of life. Whoever gives
himself, in the fear of God, to the study of these proverbs, and
conforms his life to the principles which they set forth, will be a
truly happy and prosperous man. Whoever shapes his conduct by
different principles will be compelled in the end to acknowledge
his folly. To the young, for whose instruction they were especially
intended, they are affectionately commended as their manual of
action.</p>
<p>13. In respect to <i>outward form</i>, the book of Proverbs
naturally falls into four parts. Of these, the first nine chapters,
consisting of earnest and fatherly exhortations addressed to the
young in a series of discourses, of which the parts are more or
less connected with each other, constitute the <i>first</i> part.
The title prefixed to this part, giving both the author's name and
the end which he proposes (1:1-6) refers perhaps to the book
considered as a whole. The <i>second</i> part, introduced by the
title: "The proverbs of Solomon," extends to the end of the
twenty-fourth chapter. Of this, the first section (chaps. 10-22:16)
consists of proverbs properly so called, each verse constituting a
separate maxim of heavenly wisdom for the regulation of the heart
and life. Between the different verses there is either no
connection, or one of a slight and casual character, consisting
frequently in the common occurrence of the same word. In the
remaining section (chap. 22:17-24:34) the method of exhortation in
discourse more or less connected is resumed. To the <i>third</i>
part (chaps. 25-29) is prefixed the superscription: "These are also
the proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah copied out." The
proverbs of this part are, in general, expressed in detached
maxims, as in the first section of the second part; but
occasionally there is a connection between adjacent verses. There
is also an effort to bring together related proverbs, as those
concerning rulers (25:1-8); concerning fools (26:1-12); concerning
sluggards (26:13-16); concerning busybodies and tale-bearers (chap.
26:17-28). In this part also a number of proverbs are repeated that
have occurred elsewhere. Finally, the <i>fourth</i> part, which may
be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id=
"page290"></a>{290}</span> considered as a sort of appendix,
contains the words of Agur (chap. 30), and of King Lemuel (chap.
31).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the most natural interpretation of the words
prefixed to chap. 24:23&mdash;"these [maxims] also belong to the
wise"&mdash;the verses that follow to the end of the chapter
contain also a short appendix of proverbs not belonging to
Solomon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>14. From the above it is manifest that the book of Proverbs was
arranged in its present form as late, at least, as the days of
Hezekiah. It contains not the whole of the three thousand proverbs
which Solomon spake (1 Kings 4:32), but only selections from them,
such as the wisdom of God judged needful for the edification of his
people. Whether the proverbs contained in the first and second
parts were arranged in their present form by Solomon himself or by
some other person, we do not know; but that all the proverbs of the
book belong to him as their author, except those which are
expressly ascribed to others, there is no valid reason for
doubting.</p>
<h4>IV. ECCLESIASTES.</h4>
<p>15. The Hebrew name of this book is <i>Koheleth</i>, respecting
the meaning of which there has been much discussion. The
Alexandrine rendering of this word, <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, <i>one who
gathers or addresses an assembly</i>, and the English rendering,
<i>Preacher</i>, express for substance its probable meaning; or
rather, since the form of the word is feminine, it is <i>Wisdom as
a preacher</i>, Solomon being regarded as her impersonation. The
uniform belief of the ancient church was that Solomon wrote this
book in his old age, when brought to repentance for the idolatrous
practices into which his heathen wives had seduced him. He had
thoroughly tried the world in all its forms of honor, wealth,
pleasure, and the pursuit of wisdom&mdash;speculative
wisdom&mdash;and found it only "vanity and vexation of spirit,"
when sought as the supreme good. The conclusion to which he comes
is that in such an empty and unsatisfying world, where
disappointment and trouble cannot be avoided, the cheerful
enjoyment <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id=
"page291"></a>{291}</span> of God's present gifts is the part of
wisdom, for thus we make the best of things as we find them. But
this enjoyment must be in the fear of God, who will bring all our
works into judgment; and accompanied, moreover, by deeds of love
and charity, as we have opportunity. He explicitly asserts a
judgment to come; yet his general view of life is that expressed in
the Saviour's words: "The night cometh, when no man can work;"
words which imply that God's earthly service, as well as the
enjoyment of his earthly gifts, will come to a close at death. This
view of the Preacher is not a denial of the future life, as some
have wrongly maintained, but implies rather a less full revelation
of it than is given in the New Testament.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many evangelical men, as Hengstenberg, Keil, and others,
interpret the first verse of this book as meaning not that Solomon
was himself the author, or that the writer meant to pass himself
off as Solomon, but simply that he wrote in Solomon's name, as
assuming his character; that monarch being to the ancient Hebrews
the impersonation of wisdom. Their reasons for this view are
chiefly two: <i>First</i>, that the state of things described in
the book of Ecclesiastes does not suit Solomon's age, the picture
being too dark and sombre for his reign; <i>secondly</i>, that the
language differs widely from that of the book of Proverbs and of
the Canticles. Whether we adopt this view, or that above given, the
<i>canonical authority</i> of the book of Ecclesiastes remains as a
well-established fact. It always held a place in the Hebrew canon,
and existed there in its present form in the days of Christ and his
apostles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>16. The following summary of the Preacher's argument is
condensed from Scott. He had evidently two objects in view. First,
to show where happiness could not be found; and secondly, where it
might. The first six chapters are principally employed on the
former part of the argument, yet with counsels interspersed tending
to show how the vanity, or at least the vexation of earthly
pursuits may be abated. The remaining six chapters gradually unfold
the latter part of the argument, teaching us how to make the best
of things as we find them, how to live comfortably and usefully in
this evil world, and how to derive benefit from the changing events
of life. In respect to outward things, the sacred writer inculcates
a cheerful, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id=
"page292"></a>{292}</span> liberal, and charitable use of them,
without expecting from them permanent or satisfying delight. He
counsels us to take the transient pleasure which agreeable
circumstances can afford, as far as consists with the fear of God;
to be patient under unavoidable evil; not to aim at impracticable
results; to fill up our allotted station in a peaceable, equitable,
and prudent manner; to be contented, meek, and affectionate; and to
do good abundantly as we have opportunity, in the expectation of a
gracious reward. These general rules are interspersed with warnings
and counsels to princes and great men, and to subjects in respect
to their rulers.</p>
<h4>V. THE SONG OF SOLOMON.</h4>
<p>17. The title of this book: <i>The Song of songs</i>, that is,
the most excellent of songs, indicates its application to the
heavenly Solomon, and his spouse the church. So the Jews from the
most ancient times have interpreted it. Looking at this song from
the position of the Old Testament, its ground-idea is: "Thy Maker
is thy husband." Identical with this is the New Testament idea:
"The bride, the Lamb's wife." The germ of this representation
exists in the Pentateuch, where idolatry is regarded as spiritual
adultery. Exod. 34:15; Deut. 31:16. We find it fully developed in
the forty-fifth Psalm, which probably belongs to Solomon's age, and
which is expressly quoted in the epistle to the Hebrews as a
description of the Messiah. The same figure occurs in many passages
of the prophets who lived after Solomon's day. Isa. 54:5; 62:5;
Jer. 2:2; 3:14; Hos. 2:16, 19, 20. In the book of Revelation this
imagery is repeated and amplified.</p>
<p>18. This song is not a dramatic representation, in which the
action steadily advances to the end, but a series of descriptive
pictures, the great theme of which is the separation of the bride
from her beloved&mdash;the heavenly Bridegroom&mdash;for her sins,
and her reunion with him by repentance. In the spiritual
application of its rich and gorgeous imagery we should confine
ourselves to the main scope, rather than dwell on particulars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id=
"page293"></a>{293}</span> Thus the fruitfulness of the church is
set forth under the image of a garden filled with spices and
precious fruits. But we are not to seek for a hidden meaning in
each particular spice or fruit&mdash;the saffron, the spikenard,
the myrrh, the pomegranate, the apple, the nut; and the same is
true with respect to the descriptions of the bride and bridegroom
with which the book abounds.</p>
<p>The book has always constituted a part of the Hebrew canon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language of this book is pure and elegant, with all the
freshness and energy of the best age of Hebrew poetry. Its most
striking peculiarity is the uniform use (except once in the
<i>title</i>) of the abbreviated form of the relative pronoun as a
prefix&mdash;<i>shekkullam</i> for <i>asher kullam</i>;
<i>shehammelek</i> for <i>asher hammelek</i>, etc.&mdash;which is
manifestly a <i>dialectic</i> peculiarity of the living Hebrew
adopted by Solomon for the purpose of giving to his song a unique
costume.</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id=
"page294"></a>{294}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>THE GREATER PROPHETS.</h3>
<p>1. We have already seen (Chap. 15, Nos. 11 and 12) that from
Moses to Samuel the appearances of prophets were infrequent; that
with Samuel and the prophetical school established by him there
began a new era, in which the prophets were recognized as a
distinct order of men in the Theocracy; and that the age of
<i>written</i> prophecy did not begin till about the reign of
Uzziah, some three centuries after Samuel. The Jewish division of
the <i>latter</i> prophets&mdash;prophets in the more restricted
sense of the word&mdash;into the <i>greater</i>, including Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, chronologically arranged; and the
<i>less</i>, or twelve <i>Minor</i> Prophets, arranged also, in all
probability, according to their view of their order in time, has
also been explained. Chap. 13, No. 4. Respecting the nature of
prophecy and the principles upon which it is to be interpreted,
much remains to be said in another place. In the present
connection, a brief account will be given of <i>the place which the
prophets held in the Theocracy</i>, followed by a notice, in this
and the following chapter, of the separate books of prophecy
belonging to the Hebrew canon, according to the order in our
English version, Daniel being reckoned with the greater prophets,
Lamentations considered as an appendix to Jeremiah, and the minor
prophets arranged by themselves.</p>
<p>2. The office of the prophets under the Theocracy, which we
first notice, was that of <i>bold reprovers</i>. They came to
rulers and people with an immediate commission from God to rebuke
them for their sins; and as the contents of their messages were
received from God himself, they exposed the hypocrisy and
wickedness of their times in the pure sunlight of truth, denouncing
upon great and small alike the awful judgments of Jehovah if they
persisted in their impenitence. If we except the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>{295}</span> preaching
of Christ and his apostles, the history of the world furnishes no
such bright examples of faithful dealing with men's consciences.
They never spare kings and princes from fear of their power and
patronage. They never go round about men's sins, but declare them
directly and faithfully. With what majesty of severity did Samuel
reprove Saul, and Nathan David, and Elijah Ahab, and Elisha
Jehoram, and Jehu Jehoshaphat! And if we open the books of Hebrew
prophecy which have come down to us from distant ages and from a
very different civil and social order, we find them not in the
least antiquated, but fresh as yesterday, instinct with life and
power. They are a mirror of terrible brightness in which we may see
reflected our pride, self-sufficiency, vain ostentation, and
worldliness; our avarice, fraud, overreaching artifices, breaches
of trust, bribery, oppression of the weak, and corrupt combinations
for the amassing of filthy lucre; our ambition, slander, falsehood,
intrigues, hypocrisy, and vain pretensions; our luxury,
prodigality, sensuality, and intemperance; our profaneness,
Sabbath-breaking, neglect of God's ordinances and contempt of his
written word&mdash;a mirror too in which we can see in the
background dark clouds of judgment, big with awful thunder, such as
have already come forth upon our land from the inexhaustible
storehouse of divine justice, and are ready to come forth again,
but over which hangs the rainbow of mercy for all that will repent
and humble themselves before God.</p>
<p>3. We may next consider the office of the Hebrew prophets as
<i>expounders of the Mosaic law</i>&mdash;the Mosaic law in its
substance, as distinguished from its outward form. They never
undervalued the letter of the law, since that too was of divine
appointment; but they taught men that true obedience must rise
above the letter to its spirit. When Saul excused himself to Samuel
for disobeying God's command on the ground that the people had
spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the Lord, the
prophet indignantly answered: "Hath the Lord as great delight in
burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the
Lord? Behold, to obey is better <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page296" id="page296"></a>{296}</span> than sacrifice, and to
hearken than the fat of rams." 1 Sam. 15:22. "Bring no more vain
oblations," says God to the Jews whose hands were full of
oppression and blood; "incense is an abomination unto me: the new
moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with;
it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your
appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am
weary to bear them." And his direction is: "Wash you, make you
clean: put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes;
cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the
oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow." Isaiah
1:13-17. "I hate," says God to the covenant people through Amos, "I
despise your feast-days, and I will not smell in your solemn
assemblies. Though ye offer me burnt-offerings and your
meat-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the
peace-offerings of your fat beasts. Take thou away from me the
noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty
stream." Amos 5:21-24. "Wherewith," says Micah, "shall I come
before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come
before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will
the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands
of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath showed thee, O
man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to
do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
Micah 6:6-8. Under the Old Testament, outward forms of divine
service were required, and they are necessary, to a certain extent,
under the New also. But if any man puts his trust for salvation in
these, to the neglect of inward faith, love, and obedience, he
stands condemned at the bar of Moses and the prophets, not less
than at the bar of Christ and his apostles, Under the Mosaic
economy, both the rites of divine service and the succession of the
priesthood were definitively prescribed by God himself, and
therefore to all of binding <span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"
id="page297"></a>{297}</span> authority. But the man who placed his
religion in these outward observances, to the neglect of his heart
and life, was to God an object of abhorrence, and the severest
judgments were denounced against him. It cannot be, then, that
under the gospel any system of outward forms, however right and
proper in itself, can bring salvation to the soul, where inward
faith, love, and obedience are wanting.</p>
<p>4. The last and highest office of the prophets was to direct
men's thoughts to <i>the end of the Mosaic economy</i>, which was
the salvation of the world through the promised Messiah. The Spirit
of Christ that spoke through them, "testified beforehand the
sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow." 1 Pet.
1:11. It does not appear that they understood the divine purpose to
abolish the Mosaic economy, and with it "the middle wall of
partition" between Jews and Gentiles&mdash;that great mystery, the
revelation of which was reserved for the days of the apostles; but
they did have glorious visions of the latter days, when the law
should go forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem,
to all nations; when the whole world should submit itself to
Jehovah under the administration of the Messiah; and the earth
should be "filled with the knowledge of the glory of God, as the
waters cover the sea." Their glowing descriptions of the future
enlargement and glory of Zion have been the stay and solace of
God's people in all succeeding ages. The student of the Bible
should not fail to notice that these bright visions of the future
were vouchsafed to the Hebrew prophets, and through them to the
church universal, not when the Theocracy was in the zenith of its
outward power and splendor, as in the days of David and Solomon,
but in the time of its decline and humiliation. The hopes so
ardently cherished by the covenant people of a return of the
outward glory of Solomon's reign were destined to utter and final
disappointment. It was not to feed their national pride, but to
prepare the way for Christ's advent, that God established the
Theocracy. Now that its outward glory was departing, it was
suitable that the hopes of the pious should be turned from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id=
"page298"></a>{298}</span> darkness of the present to the
brightness of "the last days" that awaited Zion in the distant
future. When Isaiah began his prophecies, the kingdom of Israel was
tottering to its fall, and before he had finished them it had
suffered an utter overthrow. The invasion of Judah by the allied
kings of Israel and Syria, in the reign of Ahaz, and by Sennacherib
king of Assyria, in the reign of Hezekiah, furnished an occasion
for predicting not only the present deliverance of God's people,
but also the future triumph of Zion over all her enemies, and the
extension of her dominion over all the earth. In his present
interpositions in behalf of Zion, God mirrored forth his purpose to
give her a final and universal victory. And so it was with all the
other prophets. With their backs towards the gloom and distraction
of the present, and their faces steadfastly turned towards the
glory of the latter days, they uttered words of promise and comfort
that can have their fulfilment only in Christ's kingdom, which is
the true heir to all the promises made to the ancient Zion. Out of
Christ these promises are vain and delusory. In Christ their
fulfilment has been begun, and shall be completed in the appointed
time. Out of Christ no amount of learning will enable a man to
understand the Hebrew prophets; for the veil is on his face, which
can be done away only in Christ. What if more than eighteen
centuries have elapsed since our Lord's advent, and the domain of
his kingdom is yet very limited? In the divine reckoning, "one day
is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
day." If it took four of these days to prepare the world for
Christ's advent, can we not allow two days and more for the
complete establishment of his kingdom?</p>
<p>We add a notice of each separate book of the Greater
prophets.</p>
<h3>I. ISAIAH.</h3>
<p>5. According to the Hebrew arrangement already noticed (No. 1,
above), the book of Isaiah, as the first of those belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id=
"page299"></a>{299}</span> to the greater prophets, stands at the
head of the whole collection of prophetical books; although Hosea,
Amos, and Jonah, and in all probability Joel also, entered upon
their prophetical office before him. Micah was contemporary with
him. Of the private history of Isaiah we know almost nothing,
except that he was the son of Amoz (chap. 1:1), and that he was
married and had sons (chap. 8:1-4). The Jewish tradition is that he
was sawn asunder under the reign of Manasseh, to which it has been
supposed that there is a reference in the epistle to the Hebrews
(chap. 11:37); but all such traditions are uncertain. Isaiah
prophesied "in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
kings of Judah." Chap. 1:1. If, with many, we suppose him to have
entered upon his office in the last year of Uzziah, we have
sixty-two years to the close of Hezekiah's reign. He certainly
exercised the prophetical office to the fifteenth year of
Hezekiah's reign, and possibly through the remaining fourteen
years. As the superscription is silent respecting any prophecies
uttered in Manasseh's reign, we are not warranted to extend the
period of his activity beyond that of Hezekiah, although he may
have survived him, and have perished in the way indicated by the
Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>6. The book of Isaiah naturally falls into two great divisions.
The first, after an introductory chapter, contains a great variety
of prophetic messages, delivered on special occasions. Chaps. 2-39.
The second division, comprising the remaining twenty-seven
chapters, seems to have had no special occasion, but to have been
written after the overthrow of Sennacherib's army, probably in the
old age of the prophet, for the comfort and encouragement of God's
people in all coming ages. "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith
your God"&mdash;this is its great theme as expressed in the
introductory verse. Of the various plans for <i>classifying the
contents</i> of the first part, all that rest upon the
rationalistic view that the book is a collection of writings
belonging to different authors and ages are false and groundless.
Among evangelical men, who hold the unity of the book and its
authorship by Isaiah, there have been <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>{300}</span> various
schemes of classification. It has been proposed by Drechsler and
others to arrange all of Isaiah's prophecies around two great
central events in the history of his times; namely, the invasion of
Judah in the reign of Ahaz by the allied forces of Israel and Syria
(chap. 7), and in Hezekiah's reign by Sennacherib, king of Assyria
(chaps. 36, 37). That these were the two great crises of Isaiah's
age, and that many of his prophecies had reference to them directly
or indirectly, cannot be denied; but to affirm that <i>all</i> his
prophecies, extending over a period of from forty-eight to
sixty-two years, were connected with those two events, either
directly or by way of anticipation beforehand and natural sequence
afterwards, is more than can be established by any probable
arguments. We must be careful not to thrust upon the prophet a
systematic arrangement beyond any that ever existed in his own
consciousness. The following brief analysis will be sufficient for
the general reader.</p>
<p>The title prefixed to the first chapter refers certainly to the
first part, and probably to the whole book. The contents of the
first chapter are well suited to constitute a general introduction
to the book, and there is much ground for the opinion that the
prophet prefixed them, as such an introduction, to the whole
collection of prophecies. The four chapters that follow were
evidently written during a period of great worldly prosperity. They
contain visions against Judah and Jerusalem of a threatening
character, but interspersed with glorious promises to the true
Israel. The sixth chapter records a vision which the prophet had of
Jehovah in the temple, with the awful message to the people which
he received from His lips. Many regard this as the prophet's
<i>inauguration</i> to his office, and consequently as the first of
his prophecies in order of time. The four preceding chapters will
then naturally fall into the reign of Jotham. There is no decisive
ground, however, for understanding the words, "Whom shall I send,
and who will go for us?" (verse 8,) as containing the original call
of Isaiah to the prophetical office. They may have reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id=
"page301"></a>{301}</span> special message which he immediately
receives; a message of the most weighty import, and often quoted in
the New Testament. The confession of Isaiah, moreover, that he is
"a man of unclean lips," may be very naturally referred to his
previous exercise of the prophetic office. According to this view,
the preceding four chapters belong to the latter part of Uzziah's
reign.</p>
<p>The series of prophecies that follows (chaps. 7-12) is connected
with the invasion of Judah by the allied kings of Israel and Syria.
In this emergency Ahaz, instead of seeking help from Jehovah, had
hired the Assyrians to defend him against the confederate forces.
The prophet predicts the overrunning of the land by these same
Assyrians in whom the Jews had reposed their confidence; and
afterwards the overthrow of the Assyrians themselves, and the
universal establishment of the Messiah's kingdom, who is foretold
under the name of Immanuel. The series closes with the millennial
song of Zion.</p>
<p>Next we have a series of prophecies relating mainly to the
heathen world (chaps. 13-23), through all of which the prophet
keeps prominently in view the great truth that the nation which
will not acknowledge Jehovah and minister to the welfare of his
people must perish. He begins with Babylon, and passes in order to
Philistia, Moab, Syria (with which as a confederate nation Ephraim
is joined), Ethiopia and Egypt (first separately and then
conjointly), Babylon again under the enigmatical name of "the
desert of the sea," Edom, and Arabia. Next follows a prophecy
against "the valley of vision," that is, Jerusalem, to which is
appended one against Shebna. The prophet then passes to Tyre, and
so he brings this series to a close.</p>
<p>The four chapters that follow (24-27) are general in their
character. They exhibit Jehovah as the avenger and deliverer of his
people, who abases the proud and destroys sinners as well within
the pale of Zion as without in the heathen world, while he exalts
his true worshippers to honor and salvation.</p>
<p>The next series of prophecies (chaps. 28-35) was apparently
delivered in view of the approaching invasion of the Assyrians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id=
"page302"></a>{302}</span> by which the destruction of the kingdom
of Israel was completed, and Judah was overrun and desolated; but
which ended in the overthrow of the invading army, and the
deliverance of Hezekiah and his kingdom. The prophet denounces,
first upon Ephraim and then upon Judah and Jerusalem, God's heavy
judgments for their iniquities, especially for the sin of making
Egypt instead of Jehovah their confidence; foretells the utter and
perpetual desolation of Edom, which here represents all the powers
that array themselves in hostility against God's people; and
describes in glowing language the glory and peace of Zion under the
future reign of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Next follows the history of Sennacherib's invasion and
overthrow; of Hezekiah's sickness and miraculous recovery, and of
his sin in connection with the mission of Merodach-baladan's
servants. Chaps. 36-39.</p>
<p>In the second part of Isaiah, which includes the last
twenty-seven chapters, the prophet is occupied with the future
redemption and glory of Zion. In the clear light of inspiration,
and in accordance with the explicit prophecy that has just been
quoted, he takes his stand in the future of Babylon's supremacy,
and of the captivity of Zion and the dispersion of her children;
and he comforts the true Israel by the promise of restoration and
elevation to a greater than the former glory, when all nations
shall submit themselves to Jehovah, and shall minister to the peace
and welfare of Zion. If we divide these twenty-seven chapters into
three equal sections of nine chapters each, the first and second
close with the words: "There is no peace, saith my God, to the
wicked" (chaps. 48:22; 57:21); while the third ends with a more
extended, threatening against the wicked (chap. 66:24). The
prominent characteristics of these three sections are thus given by
Keil:</p>
<p>"The <i>first</i> of these sections (chaps. 40-48) portrays the
relation of Israel to the heathen nations; and from the redemption
of Israel effected through Cyrus, the servant of God, it unfolds
the certain victory of the Theocracy over the gods and powers of
the heathen world. The <i>second</i> section (chaps. 49-57)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id=
"page303"></a>{303}</span> exhibits Israel as the seat of salvation
for the world. This it does by carrying out the thought that, just
as Cyrus is to redeem Israel from the Babylonish captivity, so must
the true servant of Jehovah, by his vicarious suffering and death,
make expiation for sin, raise the covenant people to true glory,
and make them, through the establishment of 'the sure mercies of
David' (55:3), the centre of salvation for the whole world. Finally
in the <i>third</i> section (chaps. 58-66), after an exhortation in
which the sins of the people are acknowledged and rebuked (chaps.
58, 59), the prophet foretells, in a series of majestic images, how
the Theocracy shall be glorified when it shall become, in
connection with the creation of a new heaven and a new earth, the
perfected kingdom of God." Introduction to the Old Testament,
&sect; 65. This view of the glorification of the Theocracy in the
latter days is pre&euml;minently just, provided only that we do not
understand the Theocracy in a gross literal sense. It is the true
kingdom of God, once embodied in the old Theocracy, but now
existing under the freer forms of Christianity, that is heir to all
this glory.</p>
<p>7. As Isaiah holds the first place among the Hebrew prophets in
the canon, in the extent of his writings, and in the fulness of his
prophecies concerning the Messiah and his kingdom, so has he been
first also in receiving the assaults of those who deny the
supernatural character of revelation. Since the last quarter of the
last century persistent attempts have been made to show that the
whole of the second part (chaps. 40-66) and various sections of the
first part, particularly all those that relate to the overthrow of
Babylon, belong not to Isaiah, but to an unknown prophet who lived
about the close of the exile. In support of this view many
arguments have been adduced; but the real argument which lies at
the foundation of the whole is the belief that no such insight into
the future is possible as that which this part of the book
manifests, upon the supposition that Isaiah was himself the author
of it. The denial of the genuineness of the chapters in question
began and has always gone hand in hand with the denial of the
reality <span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id=
"page304"></a>{304}</span> of prophetic inspiration. In the view of
rationalists prophecy is no revelation of the future through the
illumination of the Holy Spirit. It is only anticipation and shrewd
conjecture of the future from the course of the present. The
possibility of prophecy, therefore, is limited by the possibility
of human foresight. Reasoning from this false position, the critic
first assumes that Isaiah cannot have been the author of the last
part of the book which bears his name, and then proceeds to find
arguments against its genuineness. To meet him we must plant our
feet firmly on the great historic truth that God has made to men a
supernatural revelation, of which prophecy in the proper sense of
the word&mdash;the revelation of the future by his
Spirit&mdash;constitutes an important part. We do indeed find that
in the matter of prophecy, as in all other parts of God's
operations, the great law is: "First the blade, then the ear, after
that the full corn in the ear." The way for the fuller revelations
is prepared by previous intimations of a more general character.
Precisely so was it in the present case. Moses himself had more
than once predicted the captivity of the covenant people and the
desolation of their land as the punishment of their foreseen
apostacy from God's service, and also the preservation of a remnant
and its restoration upon repentance. Lev., chap. 26; Deut., chaps.
28-32. When Solomon had dedicated the temple, and his kingdom was
at the zenith of its glory, he received from the mouth of God
himself the solemn warning: "If ye shall at all turn from following
me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my
statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods
and worship them; then will I cut off Israel out of the land which
I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my
name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb
and a by-word among all people." 1 Kings 9:6, 7. When the prophet
wrote, these awful threatenings had been fulfilled upon the kingdom
of the ten tribes, and he had been commissioned to announce their
approaching fulfilment upon Judah also, and that in the form of a
captivity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id=
"page305"></a>{305}</span> in Babylon: "Behold, the days come, that
all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up
in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall
be left, saith the Lord. And of thy sons which shall issue from
thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall
be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon" (39:6, 7). Micah
also had foretold, in express terms, both the Babylonish captivity,
and the subsequent delivery of God's people (4:10). We see, then,
what a full preparation had been made for the revelations
vouchsafed to Isaiah in the chapters now under consideration. They
relate not to something new and unheard of, but to a captivity
which he had himself foretold in accordance with the threatenings
of God by former prophets. Under the illumination of the Holy
Spirit he is carried into the future of Zion. In prophetic vision
he sees her land wasted, her temple burned, and her children
groaning in captivity. As the nearest interposition of God in her
behalf, he foretells her liberation by Cyrus, the anointed of the
Lord, and her restoration to the promised land. But this is only
the earnest and pledge of a higher redemption through the Messiah,
the true servant of Jehovah, under whom she shall be glorified with
a perpetual salvation, and her dominion extended over all the
earth. To limit the prophet's vision to the deliverance from
Babylon would be to make him a messenger of glad tidings which
mocked the hopes of the covenant people; for this deliverance did
not fulfil the just expectations which his lofty promises awakened
in the bosoms of the pious remnant of Israel. No; it is in Christ's
redemption alone, of which that of Cyrus was only a shadow, that
Zion receives in full measure the glorious promises which shine
forth in this part of Isaiah.</p>
<p>If now we consider the <i>form</i> of these promises, we find
that they bear throughout the stamp of true prophecy, as
distinguished from history. They have neither the dress of prose
history, with its dates and circumstantial details, such as we find
in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, nor of historic poetry, like the
song of Deborah and Barak; like the seventy-eighth <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>{306}</span> hundred
and fifth, and hundred and sixth psalms. They are expressed in a
series of poetic images, in which, with the exception of the name
of Cyrus, all is general; images, moreover, drawn for the most
part, not from the great events connected with the conquests of
Cyrus, but from the earlier history of Israel. Let any one read,
for example, the forty-sixth and forty-seventh chapters of Isaiah,
and ask himself whether a writer who lived in Cyrus' day could have
described the fall of Babylon without specific allusions to the
agencies by which it was brought to pass. As to the <i>historic
references</i> which some find to the march of the Jewish caravans
of returning captives through the desert that lay between Babylon
and Palestine, whoever reads the passages in question without a
previously formed conclusion, must be satisfied that they are
<i>poetic descriptions</i> of the redemption and restoration of
God's people borrowed mainly from the primitive journey of Israel
from Egypt to Canaan through the wilderness of Arabia. God, as
then, goes before his people, opening for them in their extremity
"rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys;"
making "the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of
water." Even Cyrus is mentioned not as the king of Persia, but as a
man raised up from the east to execute God's vengeance on the
oppressors of his people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Ctesias and Plutarch, the name <i>Cyrus</i>
signifies <i>sun</i>. Strabo says that his name, before ascending
the throne of Persia, was <i>Agradales</i>. Some are of opinion
that the word <i>Cyrus</i> (Heb. <i>Koresh</i>) was an appellation
common to the kings of Persia. We do not need, however, the help of
this hypothesis. God himself explains the ground on which he is
mentioned by name: "For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine
elect, have I even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee,
though thou hast not known me" (45:4). According to Josephus
(Antiq. 11. 1, 2), Cyrus was moved to issue his decree for the
liberation of the Jews by a knowledge of the prophecies of Isaiah
in which he is mentioned by name. With this agree the terms of the
edict: "The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of
the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a house at
Jerusalem, which is in Judah." Ezra 1:2, compared with Isa. 44:28.
If this view be correct, the mention of Cyrus by name was a part of
God's plan for the restoration of the covenant people.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id=
"page307"></a>{307}</span>
<p>It is not true, as has been asserted, that the prophet follows
Cyrus in the details of his conquests. On the contrary, his notices
of him are few and general. As to the sins of the people which he
rebukes, they may be all naturally referred to the times of Isaiah,
while some of them, as the neglect of the established sacrifices
and oblations (43:23, 24), and the offering of sacrifices in
connection with an impure heart and life (66:3), presuppose the
existence of the temple and altar at Jerusalem, where alone
sacrifices could be lawfully offered. The sin of seeking heathen
alliances (57:9) points also unmistakably to the same period.
Although the prophet is carried forward in vision to the future of
the covenant people, he does not wholly forget the men of his own
generation, but occasionally administers to them severe rebukes,
thus mingling the present with the future, after the manner of all
the prophets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other arguments which have been urged against the
genuineness of this part of Isaiah are only of secondary
importance, and can readily be answered. It is said that the style
is more diffuse and flowing than in the first part. The answer is
that this agrees well with both the altered circumstances of the
prophet and the altered character of his theme. Most of his earlier
prophecies were delivered under the pressure and excitement of
public life, when he went before rulers and people charged with
specific messages from Jehovah, and these, too, mostly of a
denunciatory character. But the part now under consideration was
written in the serenity of retirement, with the general purpose of
comforting God's people by a view of the future glory in reserve
for them. It is entirely natural, then, that the style of the first
part should be more concise and abrupt, that of the latter more
diffuse and flowing; even if we do not make allowance for the
influence of age. But notwithstanding this difference between the
two parts, both have the same general costume, and the same
peculiar expressions and turns of thought, by which they are
sufficiently marked as the productions of the same pen. It should
be added that the Hebrew of this second part of Isaiah is in
general as pure as that of the first part. The few Chaldaisms which
it exhibits may be explained as belonging to the poetic diction.
Such Chaldaisms exist, moreover, in the earlier books. "Some words,
as <i>seganim</i> (<i>princes</i>, 41:25), may be explained by the
intercourse <span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id=
"page308"></a>{308}</span> of the Jews with the Assyrians in the
days of Isaiah." Davidson's Introduction to the Old Testament, p.
857.</p>
<p>8. It has been shown that the arguments against the genuineness
of this part of Isaiah (and by parity of reason against certain
sections of the first part) have their ground in the denial of
prophetic inspiration, and cannot endure the test of sober
criticism. The evidence, then, for the genuineness of these
chapters remains in its full force, and it is of the most weighty
character. If we look to <i>external</i> testimony, there is the
undeniable fact that, as far back as we can trace the history of
the book of Isaiah, they have constituted an integral part of it.
They are recognized as such by Josephus (Antiq. 11. 1, 2); by Jesus
the son of Sirach, in the book called Ecclesiasticus (48:24, 25);
and always in the New Testament when quotations are made from
them&mdash;Matt. 3:3; 8:17; 12:17-21; Luke 3:4; 4:17-19; John 1:23;
12:38-41, where a quotation from the <i>last</i> part of Isaiah is
joined with one from the <i>first</i> part; Acts 8:28-33; Rom.
10:16, 20, 21. That they were appended by fraud and forgery no one
pretends to affirm. The character of this part of the book, not
less than the character of those who had the Jewish canon in
custody, is a sufficient protection against such a supposition.
That they should have been appended through ignorance is
inconceivable. How can the name of so great a prophet have remained
unknown? According to the hypothesis in question, he lived about
the close of the Babylonish captivity. He was contemporary,
therefore, with Daniel; with Zerubbabel also, Jeshua, and the other
chiefs of the restoration. Did no one of these know who was the man
that prophesied so abundantly of the work which they had so much at
heart? And did his name indeed escape the knowledge of the learned
scribe Ezra? And if they did not know his name, why did they append
his writings to those of the true Isaiah, thus tacitly ascribing to
him their authorship? Why did they not leave them without a name,
as they did the books of Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, and
Chronicles? That these chapters have always constituted a part of
the book of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id=
"page309"></a>{309}</span> Isaiah, and been acknowledged as such,
is a fact which admits of but one explanation; that, namely, of
their genuineness. The <i>Great Unknown</i>, as he is called, is no
other than Isaiah himself, whom the principles of certain critics
do not allow them to acknowledge as Isaiah.</p>
<p>The <i>internal</i> evidence for the genuineness of these
chapters has already been partly considered in an incidental way.
It is found in the purity of the Hebrew, which belongs to the age
of Isaiah, not of Cyrus; in the undeniable allusions to the temple
sacrifices and oblations as then existing (43:23, 24), and to the
sin of seeking heathen alliances (57:9); and especially in the fact
that a writer living near the close of the exile must have referred
in a more particular and historic way to the great events connected
with Cyrus' conquests. It may be added that there are in the later
prophets some clear allusions to this part of Isaiah. Jeremiah, who
undeniably made use of prophecies contained in the first part of
Isaiah, was acquainted with the second part also. Compare Jer.
10:3,4, with Isa. 40:19, 20; 41:7; Jer. 31:35, with Isa. 51:15,
where a whole clause is repeated from Isaiah, which agrees in the
Hebrew to every letter; Jer. 50:2, with Isa. 46:1, 2. Compare also
Zeph. 2:15, with Isa. 47:8; Nah. 1:15, with Isa. 52:7.</p>
<p>9. The arguments urged against the genuineness of certain
sections of the first part of Isaiah are for substance the same as
these that have now been examined, and need not a separate
consideration. We come on solid grounds to the conclusion that
Isaiah was the author of the whole collection of prophecies which
bear his name, and that the arrangement of these prophecies in
their present form also proceeded from him.</p>
<h3>II. JEREMIAH AND THE BOOK OF LAMENTATIONS.</h3>
<p>10. In passing from Isaiah to Jeremiah, the contrast is as great
as it can well be; and yet it is a contrast necessary to the
completeness of divine revelation, which employs men of all
characters and temperaments, and living in every variety of outward
circumstances. Isaiah, like the apostle John, seems <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>{310}</span> to have
lived above his personal relations in the sphere of divine truth.
He never alludes to his private history, except where the nature of
a given narrative requires it. It is not probable that he was
subjected to such an ordeal of persecution as that through which
Jeremiah passed. However this may be, we gain almost no knowledge
of his private life from the book of his prophecies. But Jeremiah,
like the apostle Paul, unfolds to us very fully the history of his
inward and outward life. With his peculiarly tender and sensitive
mind it could not have been otherwise. If he had not woven into his
prophecies his own inner and outer life, he would not have written
naturally, and therefore truthfully. Through this interweaving of
biography with revelation, God has given in the case of Jeremiah,
as in that of the great apostle to the Gentiles, a rich storehouse
of truth for the instruction and comfort of his persecuted and
suffering servants in all ages. With the simplicity of truth, the
prophet informs us how the men of Anathoth, his native place,
conspired to take away his life (11:18-23; 12:6); how Pashur, the
son of Immer, smote him and put him in the stocks (20:1-6); how in
the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign he was accused before the
princes by the priests and false prophets as a man worthy of death,
but acquitted by them (chap. 26); how afterwards he and Baruch were
hidden by Jehovah (chap 36); how under Zedekiah he was repeatedly
imprisoned (chaps. 32:2; 33:1), and thrust into dungeons (chaps.
37, 38); how upon the conquest of the city by the Chaldeans he was
released from his fetters and honorably treated (chs. 39:11-14;
40:1-4); and how afterwards he was forced to go into Egypt with the
fugitive Jews (chaps. 42, 43).</p>
<p>In connection with this external history, we have a vivid
portraiture of his inward conflicts. Most deeply does he sympathize
with his countrymen in the calamities which their sins have brought
upon them; yet he is rewarded only with curses, because he
faithfully forewarns them of the judgments of heaven which are fast
approaching, and which can be averted only by hearty repentance and
reformation. "Woe is me, my mother," <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page311" id="page311"></a>{311}</span> he cries out in his
anguish, "that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of
contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor
men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me"
(15:10); and like Job he loses all composure under the pressure of
his sorrows, and bitterly curses the day of his birth (20:14-18).
Again we see him in the hands of his persecutors serenely
committing himself to God, and calmly warning them against the
guilt of shedding his blood (26:12-15). In such alternations of
impatience and faith we have a true portraiture of the struggle of
grace against the weakness of nature; and it is this which gives it
especial value as a part of revelation, which never exhibits good
men in a fictitious light, but always in the sober livery of
truth.</p>
<p>11. Jeremiah was of priestly descent (1:1); but that Hilkiah,
his father, was identical with the high priest who found in the
temple the book of the law (2 Kings 22:8), rests upon mere
conjecture. Anathoth, his native place, was in the land of
Benjamin, about four miles north of Jerusalem. He was called to the
prophetical office in his youth, and exercised it in his native
land from the thirteenth year of Josiah to the close of Zedekiah's
reign, through a period of about forty-one years (chap. 1:3); and
afterwards in Egypt, whither he was carried by the rebellious
remnant of the people (chaps. 43, 44). His first appearance,
therefore, was about one hundred and thirty-one years after that of
Isaiah, if we reckon from the last year of Uzziah, and some seventy
or more after the close of Isaiah's prophecies. During all this
time the religious and moral condition of the Jewish nation had
been steadily changing for the worse under such kings as Manasseh
and Amon; nor could the zealous efforts of Josiah avail to check
the swelling tide of idolatry and profligacy. Sent by Jehovah in
such a degenerate age to rebuke the wicked rulers and people for
their sins, and to forewarn them of God's impending judgments, he
was necessarily subjected to much persecution. Isaiah had
administered stern rebukes to Ahaz and his people, but he had
encouraged <span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id=
"page312"></a>{312}</span> them with the hope of successful
resistance to the Assyrian power. But from the Chaldeans, who had
succeeded the Assyrians as the ruling monarchy of the world,
Jeremiah could promise no deliverance. In the name of the Lord he
counselled submission, solemnly assuring the kings and princes of
Judah that their reliance on Egyptian help would end in shame and
disappointment (37:5-10). This brought upon him a load of calumny,
insult, and persecution, which he keenly felt, but bore with
fortitude, never swerving from the path of strict fidelity towards
God. The prophecies of Jeremiah do not contain so many animating
visions of the distant future as are found in Isaiah. He is more
occupied with the sins of his own age, and the heavy judgments of
God that impend over his countrymen. His mission is emphatically to
unfold the connection between national profligacy and national
ruin. This he does with a masterly hand, holding up to the world,
in the character and fate, of his countrymen, a mirror for all
time, in which wicked nations may see themselves and the ruin which
awaits them. The whole compass of profane history does not contain
so much clear instruction on this point as is crowded into the few
pages of "the weeping prophet." If the book of God's revelation
could not have been complete without the ecstatic visions of
Isaiah, so neither could it have spared Jeremiah's vivid
delineation of a profligate nation plunging itself into remediless
ruin by its iniquities. At times, however, we find in Jeremiah also
joyous anticipations of the good reserved for God's people in the
latter days. He predicted not only the Babylonish captivity, but
its termination at the end of seventy years, and the perpetual
overthrow of Babylon and the Chaldean power (25:12-14; 29:10-14).
See also chapters 30-33, where he describes, after the manner of
Isaiah, the glory of the latter days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah we have an illustrious example of one whose
reputation after death became as high and lasting, as the reproach
which he endured before death was deep and protracted. The men of
his generation could not appreciate his worth. His messages they
treated with scorn, and him with contumely. Through a long life of
faithful labor it was his lot to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page313" id="page313"></a>{313}</span> endure reproach and
calumny. But neither their unbelief, nor the burning of the roll of
his prophecies by Jehoiakim could hinder the fulfilment of his
words. When the captivity had come, as he had predicted, and
especially when God's promise through him that it should end after
seventy years had been fulfilled, he was honored as among the
greatest of the prophets, and from that day onward his name became
as ointment poured forth. The history of Jeremiah is also
peculiarly encouraging to God's faithful servants who labor on for
years amid difficulties and discouragements, and see no fruits of
their toils. When he died it seemed as if all his solemn messages
had been wasted upon that ungodly generation. But they were not
lost to the Jews who lived to witness the fulfilment of his
predictions in their captivity. In connection with the labors of
Ezekiel and Daniel they contributed greatly to bring about that
change for the better which took place during the exile. Through
them, moreover, God provided a treasury of instruction and comfort
for his people in all coming ages. How forcible a comment are his
life and labors upon the apostolic declaration made many centuries
afterwards: "Let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season
we shall reap if we faint not."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>12. Of the prophecies of Jeremiah some are without date, and
where the date is given the chronological order is not always
observed. In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the prophet, by God's
direction, dictated to Baruch, and he wrote in a roll of a book all
the prophecies which God had communicated to him from the days of
Josiah to that time (36:1-4). When the king had destroyed this
roll, he was directed to prepare another containing the same
prophecies, and "there were added besides unto them many like
words" (36:27-32). Whatever use may have been made of this
manuscript in the compilation of our present book, it is plain that
it has not come down to us in its original form as a constituent
part of Jeremiah's prophecies; since in these, as we now have them,
there is an intermingling of messages before and after the fourth
year of Jehoiakim. We cannot tell the origin of the present order,
nor is it a matter of importance, so far as the instructions to be
derived from Jeremiah's writings are concerned. Following the
Hebrew order (see below) we have the following general
divisions:</p>
<p>(1.) Prophecies addressed to Judah, with which are connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id=
"page314"></a>{314}</span> many notices of Jeremiah's personal
history, and at the close of which stands a message to Baruch.
Chaps. 1-45.</p>
<p>(2.) Prophecies against foreign nations.</p>
<p>(3.) An appendix taken almost verbatim from 2 Kings 24:18-20 and
chap. 25, and which seems to have been added by some later writer,
as Ezra (chap. 52.)</p>
<p>It is not necessary to consider particularly the attempt made to
disprove the genuineness of certain parts of Jeremiah's prophecies,
since they all rest, not on critical grounds, but on the false
principle that has been already considered&mdash;the denial of the
reality of prophetic inspiration. Men who deny that Isaiah could
foresee the restoration of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity,
must deny also that Jeremiah could limit the duration of that
captivity to seventy years. But with those who believe that "holy
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost," such
arguments cannot have weight. It is well known that Jeremiah,
particularly in his prophecies against foreign nations, made use of
earlier prophecies, as those of Isaiah and Obadiah. Compare Isa.
chaps. 15, 16 with Jer. chap. 48; Obadiah with Jer. 49:7-17.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Alexandrine version differs unaccountably from the Hebrew
text in its arrangement of the prophecies of Jeremiah. Those
against foreign nations come after chap. 25:13, and also follow a
very different order. Besides this, the Alexandrine exhibits a
number of variations larger and smaller from the Hebrew text. The
explanation of these differences in arrangement and in the text is
a matter of uncertain conjecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13. <i>The book of Lamentations</i> is designated in Hebrew by
the opening word <i>Echa</i>, <i>how</i>. The unanimous voice of
antiquity ascribes it to Jeremiah, and with this tradition agree
its internal character and style. It was written in view of the
desolation of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, by an
eye-witness of all the unutterable miseries connected with that
catastrophe. While it laments, in strains of the deepest anguish,
the desolation of Jerusalem with the slaughter and captivity of its
inhabitants, and heaps together images of horror, it ascribes
righteousness to God, and acknowledges the manifold <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>{315}</span> sins of
the rulers and people as the cause of the overwhelming calamities
that had come upon them. We see throughout the feelings of a
tender-hearted and compassionate man, of a sincere patriot, and of
a devout worshipper of Jehovah beautifully blended together. Sad as
is the picture, it is to us who contemplate it in the light of
history, not without its lessons of comfort as well as of warning.
It teaches us that in the midnight of Zion's adversity her covenant
God is with her, and that she has an indestructible life. The
prerogative which the Roman bard applied to his country: "Plunge
her in the deep, she comes out the stronger"&mdash;this high
prerogative belongs to the true spiritual Jerusalem, which no fire
can destroy, nor floods overwhelm.</p>
<p>The structure of this book is peculiar. Its five chapters
constitute five poetical compositions, each complete in itself so
far as outward form is concerned, but the whole inwardly bound
together as parts of one great theme. The first and second chapters
consist each of twenty-two verses, arranged in the order of the
twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet; that is, the first verse
beginning with the first letter, the second with the second, and so
on. Each of the verses, moreover, contains as a rule <i>three</i>
clauses. The third chapter contains sixty-six short verses of
<i>one</i> clause each, the first three beginning with the first
letter of the alphabet, the next three with the second, and so
throughout. In this central chapter, therefore, the alphabetic
structure reaches its culmination. The fourth chapter is like the
first and second, with the exception that the verses generally
consist of <i>two</i> clauses each. The fifth chapter contains
twenty-two short verses of <i>one</i> clause each, like those of
the third, but not arranged alphabetically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more artificial structure of the third chapter marks it at
once as peculiar. In this the prophet, as the representative of the
pious part of the nation, bewails the calamities that have come
upon himself and his country, expresses his firm confidence in God
and his purpose to wait for deliverance in patient submission to
his will, exhorts his countrymen to repentance, and offers up his
fervent prayer to God that he would remember <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>{316}</span> his
suffering people and punish their persecutors. The fifth chapter is
a complaint of Zion in prayer to God in view of the terrible
calamities that have come upon her. The other three chapters (the
first, second, and fourth) are occupied mainly with a description
of these calamities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>III. EZEKIEL.</h3>
<p>15. Ezekiel was especially the prophet of the captivity. Daniel,
his contemporary, received in Babylon glorious revelations
respecting the future history of God's kingdom; but he was a
statesman, exercising the prophetical office, like David, only in
an incidental way. Ezekiel, on the contrary, was expressly called
and consecrated, like his predecessors Isaiah and Jeremiah, to the
prophetical office. Like Isaiah, he has given us but few
particulars concerning his personal history. He was the son of
Buzi, and of priestly descent (1:3); belonged to that company of
captives of the better class of the people who had been carried
away with Jehoiachin by the king of Babylon when he made Zedekiah
king in his stead (2 Kings 24:8-16); and lived with other captives
at Tell-abib on the Chebar (perhaps the ancient Chaboras, a branch
of the Euphrates), where he had a house and was married (1:1-3;
3:15; 8:1; 24:15-18). That he was held in high honor by his
fellow-captives, as a true prophet of God, is manifest from the
manner in which they assembled at his house to inquire of the Lord
through him (8:1; 14:1; 20:1). Of his personal standing and
reputation, as well as of the character of his hearers, we have an
interesting notice in chap. 33:30-32, where instead of "talking
against thee" (verse 30) we may better render, as in the margin of
our English version, "talking of thee:" "Also, thou son of man, the
children of thy people are still talking of thee by the walls and
in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to
his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word
that cometh forth from the Lord. And they come unto thee as the
people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear
thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they
show <span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id=
"page317"></a>{317}</span> much love, but their heart goeth after
their covetousness. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely
song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an
instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not." Ezekiel
was called to the prophetical office "in the fifth year of king
Jehoiachin's captivity" (1:2), from which date he constantly
reckons. Jeremiah's activity as a prophet continued not only
through the eleven years of Zedekiah's reign, but for a
considerable period afterwards; so that the two prophets were for
some time contemporary, the one prophesying in Jerusalem and
afterwards in Egypt, the other among the captives in Mesopotamia.
The latest date which the prophecies of Ezekiel furnish is the
twenty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's captivity, about twenty-two
years from the time when he was called to his office. How much
longer he prophesied we have no means of determining.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date with which the book of Ezekiel opens is "the thirtieth
year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month," which
was also "the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity" (verse 2),
or five hundred and ninety-five years before Christ. Reckoning back
from this date thirty years, we come to the eighteenth year of
Josiah, when he repaired the temple, and solemnly renewed the
worship of God; and also to the first year of Nabopolassar, the
father of Nebuchadnezzar, who made Babylon independent of the
Assyrian monarchy, and thus established a new era. Some have
assumed the former of these two eras as that from which the prophet
reckons; but the latter is more probable. Writing, as he does,
under the Chaldean monarchy, it is natural that he should give, at
the outset, a date by which the chronology of the whole series of
his prophecies may be determined in reference to Chaldean history.
Elsewhere he dates from Jehoiachin's captivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>16. It is not worth while to raise any questions concerning the
purity of Ezekiel's Hebrew, as compared with that of the earlier
writers. The Holy Spirit is not concerned about the classic style
of a prophet. He selects men whose natural qualities, providential
training, and sanctified hearts fit them for the work assigned to
them; and under his inspiration they speak and write in the dialect
to which they and their hearers <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page318" id="page318"></a>{318}</span> are accustomed. Ezekiel's
style is marked by Chaldaisms, as might have been expected from the
circumstances in which he wrote. At the same time it is as forcible
as it is peculiar, a style every way adapted to the work laid upon
him. He was sent to "a rebellious nation;" to "impudent children
and stiff-hearted," with the charge: "Be not afraid of them,
neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with
thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their
words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
house" (2:3, 4, 6). How well he fulfilled his mission his
prophecies show, in which there is a wonderful fire and vehemence,
joined with a wonderful variety of representation and imagery.
Proverbs, parables, riddles, symbolic actions, vivid portraitures
of human wickedness, terrible denunciations of God's approaching
judgments, and glorious visions of future peace and prosperity in
reserve for the true Israel&mdash;these are all familiar to him,
and are set forth often with an exuberant fulness of imagery. When
summoned by God to judge "the bloody city" of Jerusalem, ripe for
the judgments of heaven, he heaps one upon another the black crimes
of which she is guilty (22:6-12). The repetitions so remarkably
characteristic of his style are those of energy, not of weakness.
They are the repetitions of a battering-ram that gives blow upon
blow till the wall crumbles before it. The same may be said of his
amplifications, as in chaps. 1, 16, 23, 27, etc. He had a
remarkable adaptation to his office; and his influence must have
been very great in bringing about the reformation of the nation
which took place during the captivity.</p>
<p>17. Ezekiel abounds in allegoric and symbolic representations.
These give to many of his prophecies a dark and mysterious
character, and make them difficult of interpretation. Jerome long
ago called the book "an ocean and labyrinth of the mysteries of
God." Nevertheless, the common reader finds in him much that is
plain of apprehension, and full of weighty instruction. Reserving
the general subject of the interpretation of prophecy for another
place, we add here a few words <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page319" id="page319"></a>{319}</span> respecting the nature of
allegories and symbols, and the principles upon which they are to
be interpreted.</p>
<p>An <i>allegory</i> is a narrative of a real event expressed in
figurative language; that is, where one historic transaction is
described under the image of another. Thus in chap. 17:1-10, the
two great eagles are Nebuchadnezzar and Pharaoh; the highest branch
of the cedar is Jehoiachin; the cropping off and carrying away of
this branch is his removal by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon, etc. So
also the extended descriptions of Jerusalem in chap. 16, and of
Jerusalem and Samaria in chap. 23, under the figure of lewd women.
For other beautiful examples of allegory see Judges 9:8-15; Isa.
5:1-6; Psa. 80; Mark 12:1-9.</p>
<p>In scriptural usage <i>parables</i> are not always distinguished
from allegories. But properly speaking parables are narratives of
supposed incidents&mdash;at least of incidents the reality of which
is of no consequence&mdash;for the purpose of illustrating
important truths; while allegories are figurative descriptions of
actual events.</p>
<p>A <i>symbol</i> represents some great truth or event of the
future under the form of an action, or some material structure or
arrangement. <i>Prophetic symbols</i> take the form of actions, and
are of two kinds:</p>
<p>First, <i>actual</i>, where the prophet himself performs some
action before the eyes of his countrymen; as in chap. 24:18, where
Ezekiel, in obedience to God's command, refrains from all
expressions of grief at the death of his wife; and chap, 37:16, 17,
where he joins together two sticks to represent the reunion of the
ten tribes with Judah and Benjamin. See also Jer. 27:2 compared
with 28:10.</p>
<p>Secondly, <i>ideal</i>; that is, seen only in vision; like
Ezekiel's prophecy upon the dry bones, chap. 37:1-10, and his
measurements of the New Jerusalem with its temple, porches, etc.
Chaps. 40-48.</p>
<p>It is often difficult to determine to which of these two classes
a given symbol belongs. Did Jeremiah, for example, actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id=
"page320"></a>{320}</span> go to Euphrates to bury the linen girdle
there, or only in prophetic ecstacy? Jer. 13:1-11. Did Ezekiel
perform the acts recorded in chap. 4 in reality or in vision? The
answer to such questions is not of great importance, since either
way the meaning of the symbols and the instructions which they
furnish are the same.</p>
<p>18. If we divide the book of Ezekiel into two equal parts of
twenty-four chapters each, the <i>first</i> part contains
prophecies delivered before the overthrow of Jerusalem. These are
arranged in chronological order. After an introductory chapter
describing the vision of the glory of God which the prophet had
when called to his office, there follows, in the form of visions,
allegories, symbolic actions, and direct addresses, a series of
vivid descriptions of the sins of Jerusalem and the judgments of
heaven that are about to fall upon her. With these are interspersed
denunciations of the false prophets that flatter the people in
their sins, and fervent addresses to his fellow-captives remarkable
for their plainness and evangelical spirit. The <i>second</i> part
opens with a series of prophecies against seven foreign nations, in
which the order of time is not observed&mdash;first, short
prophecies against the four neighboring nations, Ammon, Moab, Edom,
Philistia (chap. 25); secondly, a series of prophecies against
Tyre, to which is appended a short prophecy against Sidon (chaps.
26-28); thirdly, a like series of prophecies against Egypt (chaps.
29-32). These prophecies were fulfilled through the same Chaldean
power that executed God's righteous vengeance on the covenant
people. As the number <i>seven</i> is made out by separating Sidon
from Tyre to which it properly belonged, it is rightly held to be a
symbolic number, as in the book of Revelation and elsewhere, seven
being the well-known symbol of completeness. With the announcement
of the fall of Jerusalem (33:21) the thunders of God's wrath that
had so long rolled over her die away; and the series of prophecies
that follows is mainly occupied, like the last part of Isaiah, with
predictions of the future glory of Zion, in connection with God's
awful judgments upon the wicked within <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>{321}</span> and
without her borders. Of these the last nine chapters contain a
description of the vision which God vouchsafed to the prophet of a
new Jerusalem, with its temple, priests and altars, rising out of
the ruins of the former, of larger extent and in a more glorious
form. He sees the land of Canaan also divided out to the returning
captives by lot, as it was in the days of Joshua, but upon an
entirely different plan.</p>
<p>The general plan of the temple is after the model of Solomon's;
yet this vision is not to be understood as a mere prophecy of the
rebuilding of Solomon's temple with the city in which it stood, and
of the repossession of the land after the Babylonish captivity.
Several particulars in the description make it plain that it was
not intended to be literally understood. See chaps. 42:15-20;
45:1-8; 47:1-12; and the whole of chap. 48. It is rather a
symbolical representation of the coming deliverance and enlargement
of the true spiritual Zion, which is God's church, the same in all
ages. The resettlement of the land of Canaan, and the rebuilding of
the temple and city after the captivity, were a part indeed, but
only a very small part of the "good things to come" which the
vision shadowed forth. Its fulfilment belongs to the entire history
of the church from Ezekiel's day onward, and it will be completed
only in her final triumph over the kingdom of Satan, and her
establishment in permanent peace and holiness.</p>
<p>As the time had not yet come for the old covenant to pass away,
Ezekiel, who was himself a priest under the law of Moses, saw the
future enlargement of God's kingdom under the forms of this
covenant. The New Jerusalem which God revealed to him had its
temple, priests, altar, and sacrifices. All these were shadows of
Christ's perfect priesthood, of the spiritual temple of which he is
the chief corner-stone, and of the spiritual priesthood of his
people. 1 Peter 2:5-9. The literal priesthood, altar, and
sacrifices are for ever done away in Christ's one perfect offering
for the sins of the world on Calvary. Heb. chaps. 9, 10.</p>
<p>In interpreting the vision before us we should not curiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id=
"page322"></a>{322}</span> inquire after the meaning of every
particular chamber and pillar and door, but rather look to the
general meaning of the whole. The angel measures, and the prophet
records all the parts of the building. This signifies, in general,
that God's care extends to all parts of his spiritual temple, and
that he will see that they are in due time made perfect. The New
Jerusalem described by the apostle John has much in common with
this. It is, in truth, a vision of the same spiritual city, "whose
builder and maker is God." But it differs from Ezekiel's vision in
two respects. First, it belongs apparently to the glorified state
of the church after the resurrection; secondly, it has nothing
Jewish in it, neither temple nor altar. These shadows have for ever
passed away.</p>
<h3>IV. DANIEL.</h3>
<p>19. The book of Daniel is assigned in the Hebrew canon to the
third division, called <i>Hagiographa</i>. For the supposed grounds
of this, see above, Chap. 13, No. 4. Daniel, like Jeremiah, has
interwoven into his writings so many biographical notices of
himself, that we gather from them a pretty full history of his
life. He belonged to the royal family of Judah, being one of the
number "of the king's seed and of the princes," whom Nebuchadnezzar
had carried captive to Babylon in an invasion not recorded in the
books of Kings or Chronicles (1:1-3). Thus was fulfilled the
prophecy recorded in Isa. 39:7. But God graciously turned this into
a rich blessing to the Hebrew nation; for Daniel, having been
educated with his three companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
"in the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans," and having
"understanding in all visions and dreams," a remarkable proof of
which he gave by relating to Nebuchadnezzar the dream which had
gone from him, with its interpretation, was made "ruler over the
whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the
wise men of Babylon," and at his request his three companions were
also set over the affairs of the province of Babylon (chaps. 1, 2).
He continued in high <span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id=
"page323"></a>{323}</span> honor at the court of Babylon as a wise
and incorruptible statesman, and a prophet who had the gift of
interpreting dreams, till the overthrow of the Chaldean empire by
the Medes and Persians. By Darius the Mede he was treated with like
honor (perhaps in connection with his interpretation of
Belshazzar's dream, chap. 5), being made chief of the three
presidents whom he set over his whole realm, and a plot formed to
destroy him was frustrated through God's miraculous interposition
and turned to the increase of his honor and influence; so that he
continued to prosper "in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of
Cyrus the Persian" (chap. 6). He lived, therefore, to see the
release of his countrymen from their long captivity, though it does
not appear that he himself returned to his native land. Probably he
continued in the service of the Persian court to the day of his
death.</p>
<p>20. The first chapter is introductory to the whole book, giving
an account of the selection and education of Daniel and his three
companions by direction of the king of Babylon. The prophecies that
follow naturally fall into two series. The <i>first</i>, occupying
chaps. 2-7, is written in Chaldee from the middle of the fourth
verse of chap. 2. It unfolds the relation which God's kingdom holds
to the heathen powers as seen (1,) in a twofold vision of the four
great monarchies of the world, in the form first of an image
consisting of four parts, and then of four great beasts rising up
out of the sea, the last monarchy being succeeded by the kingdom of
the God of heaven, which shall never be destroyed (chaps. 2, 7);
(2,) in the protection and deliverance of God's faithful servants
from the persecution of heathen kings and princes (chaps. 3, 6);
(3,) in the humbling of heathen monarchs for their pride, idolatry,
and profanation of the sacred vessels belonging to the sanctuary
(chaps. 4, 5). Thus we see that the first three of these six
chapters (2-7) correspond to the last three taken in an inverse
order&mdash;the second to the seventh, the third to the sixth, and
the fourth to the fifth. The <i>second</i> series, consisting of
the remaining five chapters, is written in Hebrew. This also
exhibits the conflict between God's <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page324" id="page324"></a>{324}</span> kingdom and the heathen
world, taking up the second and third monarchies under the images
of a ram and a he-goat. Chap. 8. There follow some special details
relating to the nearer future, with some very remarkable
revelations respecting the time of the Messiah's advent, the
destruction of the holy city by the Romans, the last great conflict
between the kingdom of God and its enemies, and the final
resurrection.</p>
<p>The intimate connection between the book of Daniel and the
Revelation of John must strike every reader of the holy Scriptures.
They mutually interpret each other, and together constitute one
grand system of prophecy extending down to the end of the world.
Both also contain predictions, the exact interpretation of which is
extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, till the mystery of God
shall be finished.</p>
<p>21. That they who deny the reality of miracles and prophecy
should receive the book of Daniel as genuine and authentic is
impossible. To review the history of the assaults made by them upon
it, or of the volumes written in reply, is foreign to the plan of
the present work. A brief summary only will be given of the grounds
on which its claim to a place in the canon of the Old Testament is
vindicated.</p>
<p>(1.) The <i>unity</i> of the book of Daniel is now conceded.
"The two leading divisions are so related that the one implies the
existence of the other. Both have the same characteristics of
manner and style, though a considerable portion of the book is in
Chaldee, and the remainder in Hebrew." Davidson after Keil and
others, Introduction to the Old Testament, p. 916. This being
admitted, the book as a whole claims Daniel for its author; for in
it he often speaks in the first person, and in the last chapter the
book is manifestly ascribed to him (12:4, 9).</p>
<p>(2.) The uniform tradition of the Jews ascribed the book to
Daniel. It was on this ground that they received it into the canon
of the Old Testament. The objection that they did not class Daniel
with the prophets, but with the Hagiographa (see above, Chap. 13,
No. 4) is of no account. Had the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page325" id="page325"></a>{325}</span> book belonged, as the
objectors claim, to the Maccabean age, it would not have found a
place in the Hagiographa any more than in the prophets. The first
book of Maccabees, which contains authentic history, was never
received into the Hebrew canon, because, as the Jews rightly
judged, it was written after the withdrawal of the spirit of
prophecy. Much less would they have received, under the illustrious
name of Daniel, a book written as late as the time of Antiochus
Epiphanes, more than three centuries and a half after Daniel. That
they should have done this through ignorance is inconceivable; that
they could have done it through fraud is a supposition not to be
admitted for a moment, for it is contrary to all that we know of
their conscientious care with regard to the sacred text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may be added that the book of Baruch, which cannot be placed
later than the Maccabean age, and is perhaps earlier, makes
abundant use of the book of Daniel; and that the author of the
first book of Maccabees had this book in the Alexandrine version,
as is plain from the peculiar expressions employed by him in chap.
1:54&mdash;"they built the abomination of desolation upon the
altar." Compare Dan. 9:27 of the Alexandrine version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(3.) Josephus relates, Antiq. 11. 8. 5, among the other
particulars of the visit which Alexander the Great made to
Jerusalem, that the high priest Jaddus (Jaddua) showed him the book
of Daniel "in which he signified that a certain one of the Greeks
should destroy the empire of the Persians;" and that this, in
connection with other extraordinary circumstances narrated by
Josephus, had the effect of assuaging the king's wrath which had
been excited against the Jewish high priest and people by their
refusal to render him assistance against Darius, and of disposing
him to bestow upon them great favors. Respecting the authenticity
of this narrative there has been much discussion; but there is no
ground for denying its substantial truth. It bears the stamp of
reality, and it accounts, moreover, for the extraordinary
privileges conferred upon the Jews by Alexander, which otherwise
remain inexplicable.</p>
<p>(4.) <i>Christ himself recognizes Daniel as a true prophet.</i>
He <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id=
"page326"></a>{326}</span> refers to the future fulfilment of one
of his prophecies as a most important sign for his disciples: "When
ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by
Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoso readeth, let
him understand), then let them which be in Judea flee into the
mountains." Matt. 24:15, 16; Mark 13:14. De Wette says indeed: "In
the nature of the case Christ neither <i>would</i> nor <i>could</i>
be a critical authority." That our Lord did not assume to be a
critical authority in the ordinary sense of the term is evident;
for in this very case he referred to the Alexandrine version,
without pausing to notice its variation from the Hebrew. But our
Lord knew whether the book of Daniel is a collection of real
prophecies, or a spurious work composed several centuries after
Daniel, imposing upon the world in Daniel's name pretended
prophecies written after the events. Far be it from any one who
believes in the reality of Christ's supernatural mission thus to
make him set the seal of his divine authority to the work of an
impostor. Heb. 11:33, 34 also refers undeniably to Daniel, chaps. 6
and 3.</p>
<p>(5.) The <i>language</i> of the book agrees with the age of
Daniel. The writer employs both Hebrew and Chaldee, thus indicating
that he lives during the period of transition from the former to
the latter language. His Chaldee, moreover, like that of Ezra,
contains Hebrew forms such as do not occur in the earliest of the
Targums. His Hebrew, on the other hand, agrees in its general
character with that of Ezekiel and Ezra. Though the Hebrew survived
as the language of the learned for some time after the captivity,
we cannot suppose that so late as the age of Antiochus Epiphanes
and the Maccabees a Jewish author could have employed either such
Hebrew as Daniel uses, or such Chaldee.</p>
<p>(6.) The author manifests intimate acquaintance with the
historical relations, manners, and customs belonging to Daniel's
time. Under this head writers have specified the custom of giving
new names to those taken into the king's service (1:7); the threat
that the houses of the magi should be made <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>{327}</span> a
dunghill (2:5); the different forms of capital punishment in use
among the Chaldeans and Medo-Persians; the dress of Daniel's
companions (3:21); the presence of women at the royal banquet
(5:2), etc. See Davidson's Introduction, p. 920, who sums up the
argument thus: "It is improbable that an author in the Maccabean
times should have been so <i>uniformly accurate</i> in his
narrative, without having been in Babylon itself."</p>
<p>22. The objections urged against the book of Daniel are not of a
nature to overthrow the mass of evidence in its favor. They may be
considered under the following heads:</p>
<p>(1.) Various <i>chronological and historical difficulties</i>.
It is said that Jewish history knows no expedition of
Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem in the <i>third</i> year of
Jehoiakim. The answer is that an expedition which apparently fell
about this time is mentioned in 2 Kings 24:1. The actual capture of
the city, however, seems not to have taken place before the
<i>fourth</i> year of Jehoiakim; for Jeremiah, in a prophecy dated
in this fourth year, speaks in terms which imply that the
threatened blow had not yet fallen. Jer. 25:9. Perhaps Daniel,
chap. 1:1, dates from the beginning of the expedition, so that it
fell partly in the third and partly in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim. It was in connection with this expedition of
Nebuchadnezzar that he overthrew the army of Pharaoh-necho at
Carchemish on the Euphrates; for that event also took place in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim. Jer. 46:2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We learn from Berosus, as quoted by Josephus (Antiq. 10. 11. 1),
that when Nebuchadnezzar was engaged in this expedition, and had
already conquered the Egyptians, he received tidings that the
throne of Babylon was made vacant by the death of his father. Upon
this he hastened with his light troops across the desert to
Babylon, leaving the body of his army to return by the ordinary
route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said again that the dates given in Jer. 25:1 and Dan, 2:1
cannot be reconciled with each other. In the former of these the
<i>first</i> year of Nebuchadnezzar is the fourth of Jehoiakim, in
which year, or at all events in the preceding year, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>{328}</span> Daniel
with his three companions was taken captive. Yet after they have
been transported to Babylon and received an education there
extending through three years (Dan. 1:5), we find Daniel
interpreting Nebuchadnezzar's dream in the <i>second</i> year of
his reign. To this it can be answered in part that in the second
book of Kings and in Jeremiah the years of Nebuchadnezzar are
obviously reckoned from the time when he was placed by his father,
who was now old and infirm, at the head of his army, the title of
king being applied to him by way of anticipation. 2 Kings 24:12;
25:8; Jer. 25:1. In the book of Daniel, on the contrary, his years
are reckoned from his actual accession to the throne. But even then
it is necessary to assume a considerable delay between his return
from his Egyptian expedition and his formal investiture with the
kingdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The grounds of such a delay we can only conjecture. It may have
been connected with the settlement of the affairs of the realm,
which he found, Berosus tells us, administered by the Chaldeans,
the kingdom being kept for him by the chief man among them; or the
statement of Berosus may be wanting in fulness and accuracy. An
argument from our ignorance cannot be urged against the
authenticity of Daniel any more than in its favor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the acknowledged difficulties connected with the
identification of Belshazzar and Darius the Median (chap. 5), it is
sufficient to say that the notices which we have of the Chaldean
monarchy after Nebuchadnezzar are so fragmentary and contradictory
that no valid argument can be drawn from such difficulties against
the authenticity of the book of Daniel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An old opinion identifies Belshazzar with Nabonnedus, who was
either a son of Nebuchadnezzar or a grandson&mdash;called his son,
Dan. 5:22, in the sense of his descendant. But Rawlinson (as quoted
in Smith's Bible Dictionary) informs us that from inscriptions
deciphered by him it appears that the eldest son of Nabonnedus was
called <i>Bel-shar-ezer=Belshazzar</i>. He thinks that as joint
king with his father he may have been governor of Babylon, when the
city was taken by the Medes and Persians, and have perished in the
assault, while, in accordance with the statements of Berosus,
Nabonnedus himself survived. Upon either of the above suppositions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id=
"page329"></a>{329}</span> Darius the Median will be Cyaxares II.,
son of Astyages and uncle to Cyrus, who succeeded to the title of
king&mdash;"took the kingdom" (Dan 5:31 and chap. 6)&mdash;though
the conquest of Babylon was due to Cyrus himself, who not long
afterwards ascended the throne of the united kingdoms of Media and
Persia. Another view makes Belshazzar the same as Evil-merodach,
son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar, and identifies Darius the
Median with Astyages. It is not necessary to decide which, if
either of these two views, is correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(2.) An argument has been drawn from the fact that Jesus, the
son of Sirach, does not mention the name of Daniel in the catalogue
of his worthies (chap. 49). Such negative arguments are at best
weak, and this loses all its force from the circumstance that he
omits others, as Ezra and Mordecai (the twelve minor prophets also,
since chap. 49:10 is regarded as spurious).</p>
<p>(3.) The alleged <i>linguistic</i> difficulties have been
reduced, so far as the date of the book is concerned, to three or
four Greek names of musical instruments; all of which&mdash;the
instruments and their names&mdash;may naturally enough have been
brought from Greece, the home of musical art, in the way of
ordinary commercial intercourse. We are not called upon to defend
the classic purity of Daniel's style. A Hebrew and educated at the
court of Babylon, it was natural that his Chaldee should be colored
with Hebrew forms, and his Hebrew with Chaldaisms. The argument
from the general style of the book is in favor of its genuineness,
not against it.</p>
<p>(4.) The <i>commendations</i> bestowed upon Daniel are thought
to be inconsistent with his being the author of the book. Some, who
admit its authenticity and its right to a place in the sacred
canon, have been led by this consideration to adopt the opinion
that Daniel, though essentially the author of the book, did not
himself put it into its present form, but that some one of his
countrymen put together his prophecies, prefixing to them
introductory notices respecting the author. So far as the canonical
authority of the book is concerned there are no serious objections
to this hypothesis; but we may well ask whether undue weight is not
given to the objection under <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page330" id="page330"></a>{330}</span> consideration. Throughout
the whole book these commendatory notices are underlaid by the idea
that Daniel's wisdom is not his own, but is given him by God, and
for purposes connected with the welfare of the covenant people. By
revealing to his servant secrets beyond the ken of all the wise men
of Babylon, he manifests at once his own infinite perfections and
the vanity of the Chaldean gods; and this Daniel records to the
glory of the God of Israel.</p>
<p>(5.) The real objection to the book lies, as already intimated,
in <i>the supernatural character of its contents</i>&mdash;in the
remarkable miracles and prophecies which it records. The miracles
of this book are of a very imposing character, especially adapted
to strike the minds of the beholders with awe and wonder. But so
are those also recorded in the beginning of the book of Exodus. In
both cases they were alike fitted to make upon the minds of the
heathen, in whose presence they were performed, the impression of
God's power to save and deliver in all possible circumstances. The
prophecies are mostly in the form of dreams and visions; and they
are in wonderful harmony with Daniel's position as a minister of
state at the court of Babylon, and also with the relation of
Judaism to the heathen world. In the providence of God, the history
of his covenant people, and through them of the visible kingdom of
heaven, had become inseparably connected with that of the great
monarchies of the world. How appropriate, then, that God should
reveal, in its grand outlines, the course of these monarchies to
the final and complete establishment of the kingdom of heaven
(2:44, 45; 7:26, 27). In all this we find nothing against the
general analogy of prophecy, but every thing in strict conformity
with it. In the seventh chapter there appears, for the first time,
an interpreting angel communicating to the prophet, <i>in connected
discourse</i>, the meaning of the vision which he has just seen. So
also in the eighth chapter and onward. Such a mode of revelation is
peculiarly adapted to <i>the communication of details</i>, and in
the eleventh chapter these are given to an unparalleled extent. But
this constitutes no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id=
"page331"></a>{331}</span> ground for denying the reality of the
prophecy. Though the spirit of prophecy does not, as a general
rule, give future events in their succession, this is sometimes
done. So it is in God's announcement to Abraham of the bondage of
his posterity (Gen. 15:13-16); and also in our Lord's prophecy of
the overthrow of Jerusalem (Matt., chap. 24). In this respect it
does not become us to prescribe rules for the wisdom of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need not pursue this subject any farther. No one of the above
difficulties, nor all combined, can outweigh the evidence we have
for the genuineness and authenticity of the book of Daniel. On the
contrary, the hypothesis that it belongs to so late an age as that
of the Maccabees is beset with difficulties inconceivably greater.
It has for its foundation not sober criticism, but the denial of
the supernatural.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>THE TWELVE MINOR PROPHETS.</h3>
<p>1. By the Jewish arrangement, which places together the twelve
minor prophets in a single volume, the chronological order of the
prophets as a whole is broken up. The three greater prophets,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, stand in the true order of time.
Daniel began to prophesy before Ezekiel, but continued, many years
after him. The Jewish arrangement of the twelve minor prophets is
in a sense chronological; that is, they put the earlier prophets at
the beginning, and the later at the end of the collection. It does
not appear, however, that they intended to follow the order of time
with exactness. If they did, then in the judgment of many they
committed errors. The particulars must be discussed as the books
come up separately for consideration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In regard to the first six, the arrangement of the Septuagint
differs from the Masoretic, which is followed in our version, as
follows:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>2. This precious collection contains the earliest as well as the
latest writings of the Hebrew prophets, except such as are embodied
in the historical books; for Hosea, Joel, and Amos, at least, are
older than Isaiah, and the three prophets of the restoration are
younger than Ezekiel and Daniel. The minor prophets exhibit a great
diversity of manner and style&mdash;the rugged and sententious, the
full and flowing, the oratorical, and the simple and unadorned. In
them are passages attaining to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page333" id="page333"></a>{333}</span> the sublimity of Isaiah, to
the tenderness and pathos of Jeremiah, and to the vehemence of
Ezekiel. Nowhere do we find sin rebuked with more awful severity,
the true meaning of the law more clearly expounded, or the future
glory of Zion more confidently predicted. That some of these
writings are obscure and of difficult interpretation cannot be
denied. This arises partly from the character of the style, as in
the case of Hosea and others; partly from the nature of the themes
discussed, as in Zechariah; partly from our ignorance of the times
and circumstances of the writers. Nevertheless the prayerful
student will find in them a rich treasury of divine truth, which
will abundantly reward the labor bestowed upon it.</p>
<h3>I. HOSEA.</h3>
<p>3. The prophecies of Hosea were addressed immediately to the
kingdom of the ten tribes, yet so that he did not overlook Judah;
for he considered the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel as
constituting together the covenant people of God. Of his personal
history we know nothing except that he was the son of Beeri, for
the transactions of the first three chapters may be best understood
as symbolic acts seen only in vision. See above, Chap. 22, No. 17.
For any thing that appears to the contrary, he was of Israelitish
descent. As it is generally agreed that Isaiah began to prophesy in
the last year of Uzziah's reign, or but a few years before his
death, while Hosea prophesied in the reign of Jeroboam II., the
great-grandson of Jehu (2 Kings 14:23), who died about twenty-six
years before Uzziah, it follows that Hosea, though partly
contemporary with Isaiah, was called to the prophetical work at an
earlier period. If we suppose him to have commenced prophesying two
years before the death of Jeroboam, and then add the twenty-six
remaining years of Uzziah's reign, the sixteen of Jotham, the
sixteen of Ahaz, and two of the first years of Hezekiah, we shall
have a period of sixty-two years. To Israel this was a calamitous
period, embracing four usurpations and murders of the reigning
sovereigns, and three invasions of the Assyrians. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>{334}</span> See the
history in 2 Kings 15:8-31, and 17:1-6. In the last of these Hosea,
king of Israel, became tributary to Shalmaneser, king of Assyria;
but he proved unfaithful to his master, and sought the alliance of
So, king of Egypt. 2 Kings 17:4. For this the Assyrian king
besieged him in Samaria, and after a siege of three years, took him
with the city, and put an end to the kingdom of Israel in the fifth
year of Hezekiah, king of Judah. Hosea seems to have closed his
writings when Hoshea was seeking the help of Egypt, while he had at
the same time a covenant with Assyria (12:1), consequently
somewhere early in Hezekiah's reign.</p>
<p>4. Hosea's style is very concise and sententious, and his
diction impresses even the casual reader as original and peculiar.
A remarkable feature of his book is the constancy with which he
sets forth the relation of Israel to Jehovah under the figure of
the marriage-covenant; thus making unfaithfulness to God, and
especially idolatry and idolatrous alliances, to be spiritual
adultery and whoredom. This fact affords a key to the
interpretation of the first three chapters, where the nature of the
transactions requires that we understand them not as historic
events, but as prophetic symbols occurring only in vision. The
remaining eleven chapters contain perhaps a summary of the
prophet's discourses to the people, written by himself near the
close of his ministry. The prophecies of Hosea are repeatedly
referred to in the New Testament as a part of the oracles of God.
Matt. 2:15; 9:13; 12:7; Rom. 9:25, 26; and an allusion in 1 Cor.
15:55. The prophet brings his book to a close with a delightful and
refreshing view of the future prosperity and peace of the true
Israel, chap. 14.</p>
<h3>II. JOEL.</h3>
<p>5. The prophecies of Joel, the son of Pethuel, give no
specifications of place or time. But all the internal indications
of the book point to Judea&mdash;probably Jerusalem, with its
temple, altar, priesthood, and solemn assemblies&mdash;as the
sphere of his labors, and to the date as among the earliest of
those belonging <span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id=
"page335"></a>{335}</span> to written prophecy. The coincidences
between Joel and Amos cannot well be regarded as accidental.
Compare Joel 3:16 with Amos 1:2; Joel 3:18 with Amos 9:13; and
notice the striking similarity in the close of the two prophecies.
If we may assume that one of these prophets borrowed expressions
from the other, the priority will naturally be given to Joel, from
whose closing address (3:16) Amos takes the opening words of his
prophecies. He must then be placed as early, at least, as the reign
of Uzziah, and perhaps earlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the fact that Joel does not mention as among the enemies of
Judah the Syrians who invaded Judah in the reign of Joash, the
grandfather of Uzziah, some have placed him as early as the reign
of Joash before this Syrian invasion. There is no ground for
placing him after Uzziah; for his writings contain no allusion to
the Assyrian power, which became so formidable soon after Uzziah's
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. The writings of Joel bear the full impress of culture in a
prophetic school. His Hebrew is of the purest kind; his style is
easy, flowing, elegant, and adorned with magnificent imagery; and
for vividness and power of description he is not surpassed by any
of the prophets. The immediate occasion of his prophecies is a
double plague of drought and locusts, which has already invaded the
land, and whose desolating progress he describes in poetic strains
of matchless elegance and power. He summons the people of all
classes to repentance, and promises, upon this condition, not only
the restoration of the land to its former fruitfulness, but also
the outpouring of God's Spirit upon all flesh, the triumph of the
covenant people over all their foes, and an era of universal
holiness and peace. In this respect he is a model for all the
prophets that come after him. They all with one accord look forward
beyond the calamities of the present time, and the heavier
impending calamities which they are commissioned to foretell in the
near future, to the glory of the latter days, when Zion shall be
made triumphant over all her foes, and the whole earth shall be
given her for her inheritance. The apostle Peter, in his address on
the day <span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id=
"page336"></a>{336}</span> of Pentecost, quotes a remarkable
prophecy of Joel (2:28-32, compared with Acts 2:16-21).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The opinion of some commentators, that under the figure of
locusts are represented simply hostile armies, must be regarded as
forced and unnatural. More probable is the opinion of Henderson and
others, that the prophet uses an actual invasion of the land by
locusts as the type of a more formidable invasion of foreign foes.
But there does not seem to be any valid reason for departing from
the simple interpretation above given.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>III. AMOS.</h3>
<p>7. Amos prophesied "concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king
of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel,
two years before the earthquake" (1:1). The time of this
earthquake, which is simply mentioned by Zechariah (14:5) as
occurring in Uzziah's reign, cannot be determined. We only know
that Amos must have prophesied somewhere during the last part of
the reign of Jeroboam II., when he was contemporary with Uzziah.
Amos was thus contemporary with Hosea, and was a considerable
number of years earlier than Isaiah, who began to prophesy near the
close of Uzziah's long reign of fifty-two years. The very specific
date "two years before the earthquake" indicates that his whole
mission to Israel was executed within a single year, perhaps within
a few months. It seems to have been after his return to Judah, when
at least two years had elapsed, that he collected his prophecies
and put them into their present form.</p>
<p>Amos describes himself as one of "the herdmen of Tekoa," a small
town southeast of Bethlehem on the border of the wilderness of
Judah. 2 Chron. 20:20. It belonged to Judah, whence we infer that
Amos was himself a Jew, a supposition which agrees well with the
advice of Amaziah: "O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land
of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there" (7:12). He
speaks of himself as "no prophet, neither a prophet's son" (7:14);
which means that he had not been trained up for the prophetical
office in any school of the prophets, as were "the sons of the
prophets." 1 Kings <span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id=
"page337"></a>{337}</span> 20:35; 2 Kings 2:3, etc. God took him
from following the herd, and gave him a commission to prophesy to
His people Israel, an office which he executed at Bethel, where one
of the golden calves erected by Jeroboam the son of Nebat was
worshipped (7:10-17 compared with 1 Kings 12:29). In entire harmony
with this historical notice is the character of his prophecies. His
style has not the flowing fulness of Joel, but charms the reader by
its freshness and simplicity. His writings abound in images taken
from rural scenes and employments, some of which are very unique
and striking in their character. See chaps. 2:13; 3:12; 5:19; 6:12;
9:2, 3, 9. He opens his prophecies by a solemn annunciation of the
approaching judgments of heaven upon the nations bordering on
Israel, specifying in each case the sin which has provoked God's
wrath. The storm passes, without pausing in its course, over Syria,
Philistia, Tyre, Edom, Ammon, Moab, Judah, till at last it reaches
Israel. Here it rests, gathers blackness, and thunders long and
loud. The reign of Jeroboam II was one of much outward prosperity.
2 Kings 14:25-28. The vices which Amos rebukes are those which
belong to such a period&mdash;avarice, violence, oppression of the
poor, perversion of justice, luxury, lewdness&mdash;all these
joined with the idolatrous worship established by Jeroboam the son
of Nebat. For such multiplied transgressions God will cause the sun
to go down at noon, and darken the earth in the clear day. Their
feasts shall be turned into mourning, their songs into lamentation,
and they shall go into captivity beyond Damascus. But while all the
sinners among God's people thus perish by the sword, he will
remember his true Israel for good. He will rear up again the fallen
tabernacle of David, bring again the captivity of his people of
Israel, and plant them for ever in their own land in peace and
prosperity. Thus do the visions of Amos, like those of Hosea and
Joel, close with a cheering view of the future glory of Zion. Amos
is twice quoted in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 7:42, 43; 15:16,
17).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id=
"page338"></a>{338}</span>
<h3>IV. OBADIAH.</h3>
<p>8. The short prophecy of Obadiah is directed against Edom. The
Edomites were conspicuous for their hatred of the covenant people.
See Ezek. 25:12; 35:5-15; Joel 3:19; Amos 1:11, and the parallel
prophecy of Jer. 49:7-22. Accordingly they stand here, in respect
to both their guilt and punishment, as the representatives of
Zion's enemies in all ages. In like manner the promised victory of
God's people over them shadows forth the universal triumph of the
kingdom of heaven which is reserved for "the last days."</p>
<p>Concerning the date of Obadiah's prophecy expositors are not
agreed. The whole question turns upon the interpretation of verses
11-14. That these contain an historic allusion to the exultation of
the Edomites over the capture and plunder of Jerusalem cannot well
be doubted. If this was the final capture of the city by the
Chaldeans, then Obadiah's place will be after the beginning of the
Babylonish captivity. But since no mention is made of the burning
of Jerusalem, some suppose that the prophet refers to an earlier
capture, as that by the Philistines and Arabians under Jehoram. 2
Chron. 21:16, 17. In favor of this view is urged the fact that
Jeremiah, who was in the habit of using the writings of the earlier
prophets, has much in common with Obadiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That Jeremiah borrowed the language of Obadiah is far more
probable than that both prophets availed themselves of an older
document, as some have conjectured. Since, however, Jerusalem was
taken more than once by the Chaldeans before its final overthrow (2
Kings chap. 24; Dan. 1:1), Obadiah may have referred to one of
these earlier captures, and yet have written before Jeremiah penned
his prophecy against Edom.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>V. JONAH.</h3>
<p>9. We learn from 2 Kings 14:25 that Jonah, the son of Amittai,
was of Gath-hepher, which is undoubtedly the same as Gittah-hepher,
a town of the tribe of Zebulun in the northern part of Palestine
(Josh. 19:13); and that he predicted the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>{339}</span> successes
of Jeroboam II. According to the general analogy of Scripture,
prophecies like this, relating to one particular event, are not
separated by any great space of time from their fulfilment. He
belongs, therefore, in all probability, to the days of Jeroboam II,
when Amos also flourished. There is no valid reason for assigning
him, as some do, to an earlier date.</p>
<p>10. The story of the book of Jonah is too simple to need any
analysis. His act in fleeing from God's presence, when commissioned
to go to Nineveh with a threatening message, is very extraordinary;
but such is the inconsistency and folly of human passion. The
conduct of the mariners when overtaken by a tempest is not
wonderful: it is in harmony with all that we know of ancient habits
of thinking and acting. But what befell Jonah, when cast into the
sea, is more than wonderful: it is miraculous. That there exist in
the Mediterranean fish capable of swallowing a man entire is a
well-attested fact. The original Hebrew mentions only, "a great
fish." The Alexandrine version, and after that the New Testament,
use the word <i>whale</i> apparently in the sense of any great sea
monster. But whatever the fish may have been, his preservation
alive in its body for the space of three days, and his subsequent
ejection upon the dry land, can be accounted for only by reference
to the immediate power of God, with whom nothing is impossible. The
effect of his preaching upon the Ninevites was remarkable; but much
more so was his grief at its success, whereby God was moved to
spare the city. The common opinion is that he feared for his
reputation as a true prophet; but a deeper ground of his anger may
have been that he rightly understood the design of his mission to
the Ninevites to be that through repentance they might be saved
from impending destruction; while he regarded them as the enemies
of God's people, and unworthy of his mercy. However this may be,
Jonah's mission to the Ninevites foreshadowed God's purposes of
mercy towards the heathen world, and that too at a very suitable
time, when the history of the covenant people, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>{340}</span> through
them of God's visible earthly kingdom, was about passing into
lasting connection with that of the great monarchies of the
earth.</p>
<p>11. The authorship of the book of Jonah is not expressly given;
but may be most naturally referred to the prophet himself. The few
alleged Chaldaisims found in it may be explained as belonging to
the provincial dialect of the prophet; since we have but an
imperfect knowledge of the variations which the living Hebrew
language admitted in this respect. In Matt. 12:39-41; Luke 11:29-32
the Saviour refers in explicit terms to events recorded in this
book as being true history; nor can the historic character of the
narrative as a whole be denied except on the ground that all
records of the supernatural are unhistoric.</p>
<h3>VI. MICAH.</h3>
<p>12. Micah is called the Morasthite, probably because he was a
native of Moresheth-gath, a small town of Judea, which, according
to Eusebius and Jerome, lay in a southwesterly direction from
Jerusalem, not far from Eleutheropolis on the plain, near the
border of the Philistine territory. With this agrees the connection
in which it is named (1:13-15); for Lachish, Mareshah, and Adullam
also lay in that direction. He prophesied "in the days of Jotham,
Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah." His prophetic activity began,
therefore, soon after that of Isaiah, and he was contemporary with
him, as well as with Hosea and Amos. His prophecies related to
Samaria, the capital city of the kingdom of Israel, and to
Jerusalem (1:1). We find accordingly denunciations against Samaria
intermingled with his prophecies concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
The people, moreover, are spoken of under the name of Jacob and
Israel where, sometimes at least, as in chap. 3:9, Judah must be
included. It is generally thought that the book of Micah contains
only a summary of his prophecies, prepared perhaps in the days of
Hezekiah. But this is not certain; for the reference in Jeremiah
26:18 obviously relates only to the particular prophecy quoted
there.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id=
"page341"></a>{341}</span>
<p>13. The book is commonly distributed into three sections: chaps.
1 and 2; chaps. 3, 4, and 5; and chaps. 6 and 7. Each of these
opens with a summons to hear God's message, and then proceeds with
expostulations and threatenings, which are succeeded by glorious
promises. The second of these sections, which is the largest and
contains the most extended promises, is addressed more particularly
to the rulers of the people. The style of Micah is bold, vehement,
and abrupt. His sudden transitions sometimes make his writings
difficult of interpretation. He abounds in striking images, taken
to a great extent, like those of Amos, from pastoral and rural
life. Micah has one remarkable prophecy common to him with Isaiah.
Chap. 4:1-3 compared with Isaiah 2:2-4. From the connection of the
context the passage in Micah is generally thought to be the
original. Besides this there is a general agreement between the two
prophets in their representations; and especially in the manner in
which they perpetually mingle stern rebukes and threatenings with
glorious promises relating to the Messiah and his kingdom. The
remarkable prophecy concerning the Messiah's birth (chap. 5:2) is
quoted with some variations in Matt. 2:5, 6, and referred to in
John 7:42. The Saviour's words, as recorded in Matt. 10:35, 36;
Mark 13:12; Luke 12:53 contain an obvious reference to Micah
7:6.</p>
<h3>VII. NAHUM.</h3>
<p>14. Nahum is called "the Elkoshite," probably from Elkosh, a
village of Galilee, which Jerome (Introduction to Nahum) mentions
as pointed out to him by his guide. The tradition which assigns for
the place of his birth and residence the modern Alkush, an Assyrian
village on the east side of the Tigris, a few miles above the site
of the ancient Nineveh, rests on no good foundation. The prophecy
of Nahum is directed against Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian
empire. When the prophet wrote, this city was still in the height
of its power (chap. 1:12; 2:8); oppressing the nations and
purposing the conquest of Judah (chap. 1:9, 11; 3:1, 4). From chap.
1:12, 13 it appears <span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id=
"page342"></a>{342}</span> that the Assyrians had already afflicted
Judah, and laid their yoke upon her. All these particulars point to
the reign of Hezekiah as the probable date of the book.</p>
<p>15. The first chapter opens with a description of God's awful
majesty and power, which nothing created can withstand. These
attributes shall be directed to the utter and perpetual overthrow
of Nineveh and the salvation of God's afflicted people. The second
chapter begins a sublime description of the process of this
destruction by the invasion of foreign armies. The third continues
the account of the desolation of Nineveh by her foes. For her
innumerable sins she shall be brought to shame before the nations
of the earth, and made like populous No, that is, No-amon, the
celebrated metropolis of upper Egypt, also called Thebes, whose
children were dashed in pieces and her great men laid in chains.
The present condition of Nineveh, a mass of uninhabitable ruins, is
a solemn comment upon the closing words of the prophecy; "There is
no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the
report of thee shall clap their hands over thee: for upon whom hath
not thy wickedness passed continually?"</p>
<h3>VIII. HABAKKUK.</h3>
<p>16. Respecting Habakkuk's personal history we have no
information. The apocryphal notices of him are unworthy of
credence. From the fifth and sixth verses of the first chapter it
is evident that he prophesied not long before that series of
invasions by the Chaldeans which ended in the destruction of
Jerusalem and the captivity of the people; that is, somewhere
between 640 and 610 years before Christ, so that he was
contemporary with Jeremiah and Zephaniah. The theme of his prophecy
is, first, the overthrow of Judea by the Chaldeans, and then the
overthrow in turn of the Chaldean monarchy, each power in turn for
its sins. In the first chapter he predicts in a dramatic
form&mdash;that of expostulation with God on the part of the
prophet, and God's answer&mdash;the approaching desolation of the
land by the Chaldean armies, whose resistless power he <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>{343}</span> describes
in bold and striking imagery. In the second chapter the prophet
appears standing on his watch to see what answer Jehovah will give
to the expostulation with which the preceding chapter closes. He
receives a comforting message, but one that will try the faith of
God's people by its delay. Verse 3. It is an announcement of the
overthrow of the Chaldean oppressor, carried out in a series of
bold and vivid descriptions in which woe upon woe is pronounced
against him for his rapine, covetousness, iniquitous oppression,
and idolatry. The third chapter is a lyric ode in which the
prophet, in view of both the judgments that God is about to execute
on his countrymen through the Chaldeans (chap. 1), and the promised
deliverance from them at a future period (chap. 2), supplicates and
celebrates the future interposition of Jehovah for the redemption
of his people in language borrowed from their past history. Thus
this sublime song is both a prayer for the renewal of God's
wondrous works in the days of old and a prophecy of such a renewal.
The apostle Paul quotes the words of Habakkuk: "The just shall live
by his faith" (2:4), and applies them to all believers (Rom.
1:17).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language of chap. 1:5 implies that the desolation of the
land by the Chaldeans would be a <i>surprising</i> event, which
could not have been the case after the victory of Nebuchadnezzar
over the Egyptians and his capture of Jerusalem in the fourth year
of Jehoiakim, B.C. 606. It was also to be in the day of that
generation&mdash;"in your days." Consequently we cannot date the
prophecy earlier than B.C. 640, probably not before B.C. 630.</p>
<p>The dedication of Habakkuk's ode (3:19) "to the chief
musician"&mdash;the Hebrew word is the same that so often occurs in
the titles of the Psalms&mdash;implies that this ode was to be used
in the solemn worship of God. The added words, "on my stringed
instruments," are most naturally understood of those under his
charge as a leader in the service of song in the sanctuary. Hence
we infer with probability that Habakkuk was a Levite.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>IX. ZEPHANIAH.</h3>
<p>17. Zephaniah prophesied in the reign of Josiah (1:1),
apparently while his work of reformation was in progress and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id=
"page344"></a>{344}</span> not yet completed (1:4-6, 8, 9); that
is, somewhere between his twelfth and his eighteenth year (2 Chron.
34:3-13).</p>
<p>In the first chapter he predicts the utter desolation of Judah,
and with it the destruction of all the patrons of idolatry and the
rich and presumptuous sinners in Jerusalem. In the second chapter
he exhorts the covenant people to repentance in view of the
judgments that are coming upon them (verses 1-3), threatens the
surrounding nations&mdash;Philistia, Moab, and Ammon&mdash;with
desolation (verses 4-11), and denounces the judgments of God upon
the Ethiopians and Assyrians (verses 12-15). In the third chapter,
after a severe rebuke of Jerusalem for her incorrigible rebellion
against God (verses 1-7), he foretells in glowing language the
future purification and enlargement of Zion, and the destruction of
all her enemies (verses 8-20). The style of Zephaniah is clear and
flowing, having a general resemblance to that of Jeremiah. He has
frequent allusions to the earlier prophets. Chap. 1:7 compared with
Isa. 34:6; chap. 2:13-15 compared with Isa. 13:21, 22; 34:13-15;
chap. 1:14, 15 with Joel 2:1, 2; chap. 1:13 with Amos 5:11,
etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The genealogy of Zephaniah is given through Cushi, Gedaliah, and
Amariah to Hezekiah; for in the original Hebrew the words Hizkiah
and Hezekiah are the same. As it is not usual that the descent of
prophets should be given with such particularity, it has been
assumed, with some probability, that this Hezekiah was the king of
that name; though in this case we should have expected the addition
"king of Judah." The "chemarim," verse 4, are the idol-priests;
that is, priests devoted to idol worship. In 2 Kings 33:5, where
the writer is speaking of the reformation under Josiah, the word is
translated "idolatrous priests;" in Hosea 10:5 simply "priests,"
which is its meaning in the Syriac language. Some have maintained
that the invasion of Judah to which Zephaniah refers was that of
the Scythians described by Herodotus, 1. 105; but this is very
improbable. From the fact that "the king's children" are included
in the threatened visitation&mdash;in the Hebrew, "I will visit
upon the princes and the king's children" (1:8)&mdash;some have
inferred that they must have been already grown and addicted to
idolatrous practices; consequently that Zephaniah wrote later than
the eighteenth year of Josiah. But, as Keil and others have
remarked, the mention of the king's children may have been added
simply to indicate the universality of the approaching <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>{345}</span>
visitation; not to say that the prophetic vision of Zephaniah may
have anticipated the sin and punishment of these king's
children&mdash;Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>X. HAGGAI.</h3>
<p>18. Haggai is the first of the three prophets after the
captivity, who are commonly called <i>Prophets of the
Restoration</i>. His four short messages to the people were all
delivered in the space of three months, and they all had reference
to the rebuilding of the temple. By the slanderous representations
of the Jews' enemies this work had been interrupted, as we learn
from the fourth chapter of Ezra. Meanwhile the Jews, having yielded
to the spirit of unbelief, had lost their zeal for God's cause and
grown cold and indifferent. For this the prophets Haggai and
Zechariah were sent to reprove them, while at the same time they
encouraged them to resume the work, a mission which they
successfully accomplished. Ezra 5:1, 2.</p>
<p>19. The first message is dated "in the second year of Darius the
king"&mdash;Darius Hystaspes, who ascended the throne of Persia
B.C. 521&mdash;"in the sixth month, in the first day of the month."
Chap. 1:1. In this message the prophet sharply reproves the people
for their indifference to the cause of God's house and their
selfish devotion to their own private interests, which have brought
upon them the divine rebuke. Chap. 1:2-11. The effect of his words
in exciting both rulers and people to renew the work upon the
temple is added. Chap. 1:12-15. The second message "in the one and
twentieth day" of the same month is throughout of an encouraging
character. The elders who had seen the first house in its glory,
were despondent in view of the comparative meanness of the new
edifice. Jehovah promises them that "the Desire of all nations"
shall come, that he will fill this house with glory, so that "the
glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former"
(2:1-9). This promise was fulfilled in a material way in the second
temple as renewed by Herod the Great. But the real reference is to
its spiritual glory. It was honored by the presence of the Son of
God, who is the brightness of the Father's <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>{346}</span> glory. In
the third message, "in the four and twentieth day of the ninth
month," the prophet in a sort of parable, rebukes the people for
their heartless formality, which, like the touch of a dead body,
defiles all their offerings and services, yet promises them God's
blessing upon their repentance. Chap. 2:10-19. The last message,
which was delivered on the same day, is wholly occupied with the
future. Amid commotions and overturnings God will destroy the power
of the heathen nations, and make Zerubbabel as a signet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reference is to a seal-ring, and the promise is that God
will preserve Zerubbabel from all the assaults of the wicked.
Zerubbabel was one of the Messiah's ancestors (Matt. 1:12; Luke
3:27), and since the prophecy reached far beyond his day, the
promise made to him extends to all faithful rulers whom God sets
over his church but can have its perfect fulfilment only in the
Messiah himself, of whom Zerubbabel was a type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>XI. ZECHARIAH.</h3>
<p>20. Zechariah, the second and greatest prophet of the
Restoration, calls himself the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo
(1:1). But in Ezra the name of the father is omitted, perhaps as
being less known, and he is called simply the son of Iddo (chaps.
5:1; 6:14), the word son being used in the general sense of
descendant. There is no reason to doubt the identity of this Iddo
with the priest of that name who went up from Babylon with
Zerubbabel and Jeshua (Neh. 12:4); so that Zechariah, like Jeremiah
and Ezekiel, was of priestly descent. He began to prophesy two
months after Haggai (chap. 1:1 compared with Hag. 1:1), and the two
prophets were contemporary, at least for a short time.</p>
<p>21. The book of Zechariah may be naturally divided, according to
its contents, into three parts. The first six chapters constitute
the <i>first</i> of these parts. After a short introductory message
(1:1-6) there follows a very remarkable series of visions relating
to the re&euml;stablishment of the Jews in their own land, and the
future dispensations of God towards them; the whole being closed by
a symbolic prophecy of Christ as both priest and king upon the
throne of David. To the <i>second</i> part <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>{347}</span> belong
the prophecies contained in the seventh and eighth chapters. The
occasion of the first of these was a question proposed to the
prophet concerning the observance of a certain fast. He first
rebukes the people for their formality, and then proceeds to
encourage them in the way of duty, adding glorious promises
respecting the future prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem. The
remaining six chapters, constituting the <i>third</i> part, appear
to have been written at a later time. They all relate to the future
destinies of the covenant people, and, through them, of the visible
kingdom of God on earth. But the first three of these chapters are
mainly occupied with the nearer future, yet with glimpses at the
final consummation in the latter days. They are generally
understood to predict the conquests of Alexander the Great (9:1-8),
the conflict of the Jews with their enemies in the Maccabean age
(9:13-16), the advent of Christ (9:9), the corrupt and rapacious
character of the Jewish rulers at that era, their rejection of
Christ, and the consequent rejection of the nation by God (chap.
11). They also contain a prediction of the final reunion and
restoration of "the house of Judah" and "the house of Joseph" (ch.
10). The remaining three chapters are occupied with the great and
decisive conflict of the last days, which is to usher in the era of
millennial glory.</p>
<p>22. The prophecies of Zechariah, containing as they do a
portraiture of the destiny of God's people to the end of time, and
comprehending so many mighty events which yet await their
fulfilment, present to the interpreter many difficulties, some of
which have hitherto been found insoluble, and will probably remain
unsolved till the mystery of God contained in them shall have been
fulfilled. One thing, however, they clearly reveal to us: that the
future triumph of God's kingdom is certain, and that all the great
movements in the history of the nations, however unpropitious they
may seem at the time, are parts of the mighty plan of divine
providence which shall end in making the kingdoms of this world the
kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id=
"page348"></a>{348}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>In Matt. 27:9, 10, there is a quotation for substance of the
words of Zechariah 11:13, but they are ascribed to "Jeremiah the
prophet." Of this discrepancy various explanations have been
proposed. Some have suspected an early error in the manuscript of
Matthew's gospel; but of this there is no satisfactory proof.
Others have thought that the part of our present book of Zechariah
which contains the prophecy in question actually belongs to
Jeremiah; but upon this hypothesis it remains a mystery how it
should have been attached to the writings of Zechariah.</p>
<p>Upon the ground of diversity of style and other alleged internal
marks, it has been maintained by some biblical scholars that the
whole of the last part of Zechariah belongs to an earlier age; but
the validity of this conclusion is denied by others. To give even a
summary of the opposing arguments would exceed the limits of the
present work. The internal proofs being very nearly balanced
against each other, the fact that these chapters have always been
connected with the writings of Zechariah ought to be allowed a
decisive influence in favor of their genuineness.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>XII. MALACHI.</h3>
<p>23. In Hebrew Malachi signifies <i>my messenger</i>, being the
very word employed in chap. 3:1. Hence some have supposed that this
is not the prophet's name, but a description of his office. Such a
supposition, however, is contrary to scriptural usage, which in
every other case prefixes to each of the prophetical books the
author's proper name. Malachi has not given the date of his
prophecies, but it can be determined with a good degree of
certainty from their contents. The people had been reinstated in
the land, the temple rebuilt, and its regular services
re&euml;stablished. Yet they were in a depressed condition,
dispirited, and disposed to complain of the severity of God's
dealings towards them. Their ardently cherished expectation of
seeing the Theocracy restored to its former glory was not realized.
Instead of driving their enemies before them sword in hand, as in
the days of Joshua, or reigning triumphantly over them in peace, as
in the days of Solomon, they found themselves a handful of weak
colonists under the dominion of foreigners, and returning to the
land of their fathers solely by their permission. All this was
extremely humiliating to their worldly pride, and a bitter
disappointment of their worldly hopes. Hence they had fallen into a
desponding and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id=
"page349"></a>{349}</span> complaining state of mind. While
rendering to God a service that was not cheerful but grudging,
complaining of its wearisomeness, withholding the tithes required
by the law of Moses, and offering in sacrifice the lame and the
blind, they yet complained that he did not notice and requite these
heartless services, and talked as if he favored the proud and
wicked. "Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is
it that we have kept his ordinance, and walked mournfully before
him? And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work
wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered"
(3:14, 15). To these sins they had added that of putting away their
Hebrew wives, that they might marry foreign women (2:10-16). All
these circumstances point to the administration of Nehemiah,
probably the latter part of it; for after his visit to Babylon in
the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes (Neh. 13:6), he found upon his
return, and has described in the last chapter of his book precisely
the same state of affairs. Malachi is thus the last of all the
prophets.</p>
<p>24. He opens his prophecies by reminding the people of God's
great and distinguishing love towards them and their fathers, which
they were so slow to acknowledge. He then reproves them sharply for
the sins above referred to, and forewarns them that the Lord, of
whose delay they complain, will suddenly come to his temple to sit
in judgment there&mdash;an advent which they will not be able to
endure; for it will consume the wicked root and branch, while it
brings salvation to the righteous (3:1-5; 4:1-3). In view of the
fact that the revelations of the Old Testament are now closing, he
admonishes the people to remember the law of Moses, and closes with
a promise of the mission of "Elijah the prophet before the coming
of the great and dreadful day of the Lord" (4:5, 6). This promise,
with that contained in chap. 3:1, is repeatedly referred to in the
New Testament, and applied to the coming of John the Baptist as our
Lord's forerunner. The opening words of the prophecy, chap. 1:2,
are quoted by the apostle Paul (Rom. 9:13).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id=

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>THE APOCRYPHAL BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>1. The Greek word <i>Apocrypha</i>, <i>hidden</i>, that is,
<i>hidden</i> or <i>secret</i> books, was early applied by the
fathers of the Christian church to anonymous or spurious books that
falsely laid claim to be a part of the inspired word. By some, as
Jerome, the term was extended to all the books incorporated by the
Alexandrine Jews, in their Greek version, into the proper canon of
the Old Testament, a few of which books, though not inspired, are
undoubtedly genuine. Another designation of the books in question
was <i>ecclesiastical</i>, books to be read in the churches for
edification, but not as possessing authority in matters of faith.
But at the era of the Reformation, when these books were separated
by the Protestant churches from the true canon, and placed by
themselves between the books of the Old and the New Testament,
Jerome's old epithet <i>Apocrypha</i>, or the <i>Apocryphal
books</i>, was applied to the entire collection.</p>
<p>How the term <i>Apocrypha</i>, <i>hidden</i>, became associated
with the idea of <i>spurious</i> or <i>anonymous</i> is doubtful.
According to Augustine, it was because the origin of these books
was not clear to the church fathers. A later conjecture, expressed
by the translators of the English Bible, is "because they were wont
to be read not openly and in common, but as it were in secret and
apart." Still more probable is the opinion that they were so called
from their close relation to the <i>secret</i> books containing the
mysteries&mdash;secret doctrines&mdash;of certain heretical
sects.</p>
<p>2. The date of several of the apocryphal books is very
uncertain; but none of them can well be placed as early as the
beginning of the third century before Christ. Though some of them
were originally written in Hebrew or Aramean, they have been
preserved to us only in Greek or other versions. None of them were
ever admitted into the Hebrew canon. The ground of their rejection
is well stated by Josephus (Against Apion 1, 8), namely, that from
the time of Artaxerxes, Xerxes' son (Artaxerxes Longimanus, under
whom Ezra led forth his colony, Ezra 7:1, 8), "the exact succession
of the prophets" was wanting. The Alexandrine Jews, however, who
were very loose in their ideas of the canon, incorporated them into
their version of the Hebrew Scriptures. How far the mass of the
people distinguished between their authority and that of the books
belonging to the Hebrew canon is a question not easily determined.
But <span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id=
"page351"></a>{351}</span> Josephus, as we have seen, clearly
recognized their true character. Philo also, as those who have
examined the matter inform us, though acquainted with these books,
never cites any one of them as of divine authority. The judgment of
these two men doubtless represents that of all the better informed
among the Alexandrine Jews, as it does that of the Saviour and his
apostles, who never quote them as a part of the inspired word.</p>
<p>3. During the first three centuries of the Christian era very
few of the church fathers had any knowledge of Hebrew. The churches
received the Scriptures of the Old Testament through the medium of
the Alexandrine Greek version, which contained the apocryphal
books. It is not surprising, therefore, that the distinction
between these and the canonical books was not clearly maintained,
and that we find in the writings of the church fathers quotations
from them even under the name of "divine scripture." But Jerome,
who translated the Old Testament from the Hebrew, understood
perfectly the distinction between the canonical and the apocryphal
books. The canon which he has given agrees with that of the
Palestine Jews. He says (Prologus Galeatus) of the apocryphal books
Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobit, and Maccabees, that the
church reads these "for the edification of the people, not for
authority in establishing church doctrines." The same distinction
is made by Rufinus, the contemporary and antagonist of Jerome. The
language of Augustine was more wavering and uncertain. At the
Council of Hippo, A.D. 393, at which he was present, the
"ecclesiastical books," as the apocryphal books are called, were
included in the catalogue of sacred books; and from that day to the
time of the Reformation the extent of the Old Testament canon was
regarded as an open question. But the Romish Council of Trent
included the apocryphal books in the canon of the Old Testament,
with the exception of Esdras and the prayer of Manasseh,
pronouncing an anathema on all who should hold a contrary opinion.
The Protestant churches, on the other hand, unanimously adhered to
the Hebrew canon, separating from this the apocryphal books as
useful for reading, but of no authority in matters of faith.</p>
<p>4. Although the Protestant churches rightly reject the
apocryphal books as not belonging to the inspired word, the
knowledge of their contents is nevertheless a matter of deep
interest to the biblical scholar. The first book of Maccabees is in
the main authentic, and it covers an important crisis of Jewish
history. All of the apocryphal books, moreover, throw much light on
the progress of Jewish thought, especially in the two directions of
Grecian culture and a rigid adherence to the forms of the Mosaic
law. Keil divides the apocryphal books into <i>historical</i>,
<i>didactic</i>, and <i>prophetic</i>, but with the remark that
this division cannot be rigidly carried out. In the following brief
notice of the several books the arrangement of the English Bible is
followed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id=
"page352"></a>{352}</span>
<h3>I. THE TWO BOOKS OF ESDRAS.</h3>
<p>5. The first two in order of the apocryphal books in the English
version bear the title of <i>Esdras</i>, that is, <i>Ezra</i>. The
Greek Bible has only the first, which stands sometimes before our
canonical book of Ezra, and sometimes after Nehemiah. In the former
case it is called the <i>first</i> book of Esdras, that is, Ezra;
in the latter the <i>third</i>, Nehemiah being reckoned as the
continuation of Ezra, and called the <i>second</i> book of Ezra. It
gives the history of the temple and its service from Josiah to
Ezra&mdash;its restoration by Josiah, destruction by the Chaldees,
rebuilding and re&euml;stablishment through Zerubbabel and Ezra.
Its original and central part is a legend from an unknown source
respecting a trial of wisdom between Zerubbabel and two other young
men, made in the presence of Darius, king of Persia, which resulted
in Zerubbabel's favor, and so pleased the king that he issued
letters for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and conferred many other
favors on the Jews. Chaps. 3, 4. The preceding and following parts
are made up of extracts from 2 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah, in
which the compiler has made a free use of his biblical sources, at
one time abridging the narrative, at another making explanatory
additions, and again transposing the order of events contrary to
historical truth. Some, as Keil, think that the writer made use of
the Alexandrine version; others, that he drew from the original
Hebrew. His design was to exhibit the liberality of Cyrus and
Darius towards the Jews as a pattern for the heathen rulers of
Judea in his own day. (Keil.) Neither the author nor the date of
the book is known, but it cannot be placed earlier than the second
century before Christ.</p>
<p>6. The <i>second</i> book of Esdras (called also the
<i>fourth</i>, when the first is reckoned as the third) is extant
in a Latin, an Arabic, and an Ethiopic version. The Greek original
has not thus far been found. The Arabic and Ethiopic are thought to
represent the primitive text more correctly than the Latin: as they
want the two introductory and closing chapters of the latter, which
are generally admitted to be spurious additions by a later hand;
and contain, on the contrary, a long passage after chap. 7:35,
which is not found in the Latin, and is thought to be genuine.</p>
<p>7. If we reject the first two and last two chapters of the Latin
version, which do not belong to the original work, the remainder of
the book has entire unity from beginning to end. It consists of a
series of pretended visions vouchsafed to Ezra through the angel
Uriel in the thirtieth year after the destruction of Jerusalem by
the Chaldees, while he mourned over the desolate and distressed
condition of the covenant people with fasting and prayer. Of these
visions, the first six, which are preparatory to the last, pertain
mainly to the method of God's dealing with men, the end of the
present age, the introduction of the coming age, and the
glorification <span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id=
"page353"></a>{353}</span> of Zion, with the heavy judgments of God
that shall accompany these events. Many of these revelations are
made through the medium of symbols. In the seventh and last
revelation, a voice addresses Ezra out of a bush, as it did Moses
of old. Upon his complaining that the law has been burnt, he is
directed to take five ready scribes, with a promise that the holy
writings which are lost shall be restored to his people. The next
day the voice calls to him again, commanding him to open his mouth
and drink the cup which is offered to him, "full as it were with
water, but the color of it was like fire." Upon this he is filled
with the spirit of inspiration, and dictates to his five scribes in
forty days 204 books (according to some 94). Of these the last 70
are secret, to be delivered only "to such as be wise among the
people." The rest are to be published openly, that the worthy and
unworthy may read them. The historic truth underlying this fabulous
revelation seems to be the revision of the canon of the Old
Testament by Ezra and his associates. Chap. 15, No. 17. It is
agreed that this book is the production of a Jew, but the date of
its composition is a disputed point. Some assign it to the first
century after Christ; others to the century preceding our Lord's
advent, but with interpolations that manifestly belong to the
Christian era.</p>
<h3>II. TOBIT.</h3>
<p>8. The book of Tobit contains a narrative of the piety,
misfortunes, and final prosperity of Tobit, an Israelite of the
tribe of Naphtali, who was among the captives brought to Assyria by
Enemessar (Shalmaneser) king of Assyria. With Enemessar he was in
favor, became his purveyor, and was able to deposit ten talents of
silver with Gabael at Rages, a city of Media. But Sennacherib, the
successor of Enemessar, persecuted him, especially for his pious
care in burying the bodies of his Jewish brethren whom that king
had slain, and he was obliged to flee with his wife Anna and his
son Tobias, leaving all his goods as plunder to the Assyrian king.
Under Sarchedonus (Esarhaddon) he returned again to his home, but
soon a new misfortune overtook him. As he lay one night by the wall
of his courtyard, being unclean from the burial of a Jew whom his
son had found strangled in the market-place, "the sparrows muted
warm dung" into his eyes, which deprived him of sight. Wishing now
to send his son Tobias for the ten talents of silver deposited with
Gabael at Rages in Media, he directs him to seek a guide for the
way; when the angel Raphael offers himself under the name of
Azarias the son of Ananias the great, one of Tobit's brethren. As
the angel and Tobias journey together, they come one evening to the
river Tigris. As the young man goes down to the river to bathe, a
fish assaults him; but by the angel's direction he seizes him,
drags him on shore, and takes for future use his heart, liver, and
gall. On their way to Rages they come to Ecbatane, a city of Media,
where resides <span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id=
"page354"></a>{354}</span> Raguel, the cousin of Tobias, whose only
daughter, Sara, has lost seven husbands on the night of their
marriage, through the power of Asmodeus, an evil spirit. Tobias
being her nearest surviving kinsman, marries her according to the
law of Moses. By the angel's direction, upon entering the
marriage-chamber, he lays the heart and liver of the fish upon
embers. The evil spirit, at the smell of the smoke, flees away into
the utmost parts of Egypt, where the angel binds him. The angel
goes to Rages and brings the ten talents and Gabael himself to the
wedding feast; the wedded pair return in safety to Tobit with the
silver, and also the half of Raguel's goods, which Sara receives as
her wedding portion. Finally Tobias, by the angel's direction,
anoints his father's eyes with the gall of the fish; whereupon he
recovers his sight, and lives in honor and prosperity to a good old
age. Such is a brief outline of the story, which is told in an
interesting and attractive style. How much historic truth lies at
its foundation, it is impossible to determine. The introduction of
the angelic guide may well be regarded as a mythical
embellishment.</p>
<p>9. The book of Tobit is extant in various texts&mdash;Greek,
Latin, Syriac, and Hebrew, the Hebrew forms being all translations
from the Greek or Latin. These texts differ in minor details, but
have all sprung directly or indirectly from one original, which was
probably Hebrew or Aramaic, though some maintain that it was Greek.
The book is thoroughly Jewish in its spirit. The date of its
composition is uncertain. The common opinion of biblical scholars
is that it was composed about 250-200 B.C. In its general scope the
book has a resemblance to that of Job. A good man encounters
suffering in the way of piety, but is finally delivered, lives in
prosperity, and dies in a good old age. The portraiture which it
gives of domestic piety is very pleasing, and affords an
instructive insight into the spirit of the age in which it was
written. It gives great prominence to deeds of charity; but the
alms on which it insists so earnestly flow from inward faith and
love. In this respect they are distinguished from the dead works of
the late Scribes and Pharisees.</p>
<h3>III. JUDITH.</h3>
<p>10. This book relates the exploit of Judith, a Jewish widow
distinguished alike for beauty, courage, and devotion to her
country. When Holofernes, one of Nebuchadnezzar's generals, was
besieging Bethulia, a city of Judea, she went over to his camp with
her maid in the character of a deserter, promised to guide him to
Jerusalem, and by her flattery and artful representations so
insinuated herself into his favor that he entertained her with high
honor. At last, being left alone with him at night in his tent, she
beheaded him with his own falchion as he lay asleep and
intoxicated, and going forth gave his head to her maid, who put it
in her bag, and they two passed the guards in safety under the
pretext of going <span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id=
"page355"></a>{355}</span> out for prayer, as had been their
nightly custom. The head of Holofernes was suspended from the wall
of the city, and when the warriors within sallied forth, the
besieging army fled in consternation. Judith receives as a reward
all the stuff of Holofernes, lives at Bethulia as a widow in high
honor, and dies at the age of one hundred and five.</p>
<p>11. The historical and geographical contradictions of this book
are too many and grave to allow the supposition that it contains an
authentic narrative of facts. It was manifestly written after the
return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity and the rebuilding
of the city and temple (chaps. 4:3; 5:18, 19), when the nation was
governed, not by a king, but by a high priest and Sanhedrim. Chap.
4:6, 8; 15:8. Yet it makes Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned in Babylon
long before, king in Nineveh in the eighth year of his reign,
whereas his father had destroyed Nineveh. The attempts that have
been made to reconcile these and other inconsistencies with true
history are forced and unnatural. Whatever historical truth may lie
at the basis of the story, it is so interwoven with fiction that
the two elements cannot be separated from each other. It was
probably written by a Palestinian Jew in Hebrew or Aramaic
somewhere about the second century before Christ. The design of the
book is to excite the people to faith and courage in their severe
conflicts with foreign persecutors; but its morality is of a very
questionable character. Judith, its heroine, while she adheres with
great punctiliousness to the Mosaic ritual, does not scruple to
employ hypocrisy and falsehood that she may prepare the way for
assassination, being evidently persuaded that in the service of the
covenant people the end sanctifies the means.</p>
<h3>IV. ADDITIONS TO THE BOOK OF ESTHER.</h3>
<p>12. These are printed by themselves in our English version, and
entitled: "The rest of the chapters of the Book of Esther, which
are found neither in the Hebrew, nor in the Chaldee;" but in the
Septuagint and old Latin they are dispersed through the canonical
book so as to form with it a consistent whole. They profess to
supply deficiencies in the canonical Esther&mdash;a dream of
Mordecai with its interpretation; an account of the conspiracy of
the two eunuchs to destroy Ahasuerus; a pretended copy of the
king's edict for the destruction of the Jews; the prayer of
Mordecai and of Esther in view of this edict; various details of
Esther's visit to the king; and the pretended edict of Artaxerxes
(Ahasuerus) revoking the former edict, and giving the Jews liberty
to destroy all who should assault them&mdash;into which the name of
God, which nowhere appears in the genuine book of Esther, is
abundantly introduced. The origin of these legends is unknown.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id=
"page356"></a>{356}</span>
<h3>V. THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON.</h3>
<p>13. The author of this book personages Solomon, and speaks in
his name, Solomon being to the ancient Jews the representative of
all wisdom. Keil gives the summary of its contents in three
divisions, as follows; (1.) "The book begins with a forcible
exhortation to the rulers of the earth to strive after wisdom as
the fountain of righteousness and the guide to immortality and
happiness. With this it connects a warning against the folly of
unbelieving men who rebel against the law, oppress the righteous,
and thus bring upon themselves just punishment, distraction, and
everlasting shame. Chaps. 1-6. (2.) After the example of King
Solomon, who is introduced as speaking, the way to obtain wisdom is
next pointed out, and she is described in her nature as the spirit
that formed and sustains the world, and is the author of all that
is good, true, and great. Chaps. 7-9. (3.) Then follows a long
historical discourse (interrupted in chaps. 13-15 by a copious
discussion concerning the origin and nature of idolatry), in which
the blessed effects of wisdom and the fear of God, and the unhappy
consequences that come from the folly of idolatry are illustrated
by the opposite fortunes of the righteous and the wicked of past
ages, especially of the people of God as contrasted with the
idolatrous Canaanites and Egyptians." The different parts of the
book constitute a well connected whole.</p>
<p>14. The book was originally composed in Greek by an Alexandrine
Jew, who is generally placed by biblical scholars somewhere in the
second century before Christ. Though possessing no canonical
authority, it is very interesting and valuable for the view which
it gives of the progress of Jewish thought in both religion and
philosophy. This writer is the first who expressly identifies the
serpent that deceived Eve with the devil: "Through envy of the
devil came death into the world." Chap. 2:24. He teaches also the
doctrine of the immortality of the soul and of a future judgment.
In a passage of great beauty he personifies Wisdom, after the
example of the book of Proverbs, as the worker of all things, and
the teacher and guide, of men. "She is the breath of the power of
God, and a pure efflux from the glory of the Almighty; therefore
nothing defiled can find entrance into her. For she is the
effulgence of the everlasting light, and the unspotted mirror of
the divine might, and the image of his goodness. And being but one
she can do all things; and remaining in herself [unchanged] she
makes all things new. From age to age entering into holy souls, she
makes them friends of God and prophets." Chap. 7:25-27. But along
with this true development of doctrine on the basis of the Old
Testament he holds the unscriptural doctrine of the
pre&euml;xistence of souls (chap. 8:20), whether borrowed from the
Platonists, or taken from some other source. Some have thought that
he also holds matter to be eternal. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page357" id="page357"></a>{357}</span> But when he speaks of God's
almighty hand as having "created the world out of formless matter"
(chap. 11:17), he may have reference simply to the chaotic state
described in Gen. 1:2.</p>
<p>Jerome left the Latin translation of this book unrevised. The
text, therefore, of our Latin Bibles is that of the "Old Latin"
version, as it existed before his day.</p>
<h3>VI. ECCLESIASTICUS.</h3>
<p>15. The Greek title of this book is, <i>The Wisdom of Jesus the
son of Sirach</i>, or more briefly: <i>The Wisdom of Sirach</i>.
The Latin title, <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>, that is,
<i>Ecclesiastical</i> book, designates it as a book that was read
for edification in the churches, though not included in the Hebrew
canon. We give, mainly from Keil, the summary of its contents: This
copious book is rich in its contents, embracing the whole domain of
practical wisdom, and, what is inseparable from this, the fear of
God. These virtues it describes, commends, and inculcates according
to their origin and nature, their characteristics and results, and
their realization in life, in a rich collection of proverbs, with
rules and counsels for the regulation of life in all its manifold
relations. The whole is after the manner of the Proverbs of
Solomon, only with much greater particularity of details, extending
to all the spheres of religious, civil, and domestic life, and
giving rules of conduct for the regulation of the same. This
collection of wise maxims, moral precepts, and rules of life
constitutes a united whole, in which the particular proverbs,
counsels, and warnings are strung together in accordance with an
association of ideas that is often quite loose. Interwoven with
these are a number of connected discussions and prayers. The author
closes his instructions with two extended discourses, in the former
of which he celebrates the works of God in creation (chaps.
42:15-43:33); in the latter, the praises of the famous men of
Scripture from Enoch to Simon the high priest, the son of Onias
(chaps. 44-50). He then adds in the final chapter a thanksgiving
and prayer (chap. 51). This book, like that of Wisdom, is of great
value for the insight which it gives into the theology and ethics
of the Jews at the time of its composition.</p>
<p>16. It is undoubtedly genuine, having been written in Hebrew by
the man whose name it bears, and translated into Greek in Egypt by
his grandson, as stated in the prologue. But the age of the
translator, and consequently of the author, is a matter of dispute.
The last of the worthies described by him is "Simon, the son of
Onias, the high priest." There were two high priests of this name,
both sons of Onias, but the author's eulogy is applicable only to
the former, who flourished about 310-290 B.C. It is a natural
inference that Jesus, the son of Sirach, wrote not many years
afterwards. The translator, again, speaks of himself as coming into
Egypt "in the eight and thirtieth year, when Euergetes <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>{358}</span> was
king." Does he mean the eight and thirtieth year of his <i>own</i>
life, or of <i>Euergetes</i>' reign? If the latter, then of the two
kings that bore the surname Euergetes the latter only (B.C.
170-117) can be understood, since the former reigned only
twenty-five years. If the former, as is most probable, then we
naturally understand Euergetes I., who reigned B.C. 217-222, during
which period the translation must have been executed.</p>
<p>The Greek text, as exhibited in manuscripts, is in a very
corrupt and confused state, with many variations and
transpositions. The Latin text is that of the "Old Latin," which
Jerome left, as he did that of the book of Wisdom, without
revision.</p>
<h3>VII. BARUCH AND THE EPISTLE OF JEREMIAH.</h3>
<p>17. This is the only apocryphal book which assumes the character
of prophecy. It is formed after the model of Jeremiah, and ascribed
to Baruch his friend. But its spuriousness is generally admitted.
Besides historical inaccuracies, such as are not conceivable in the
case of Baruch, the fact that its author employed the Septuagint
translation of Jeremiah and Daniel mark it as of a later date. Keil
assigns it to about the middle of the second century B.C. The book
professes to be a letter written by Baruch in the name of the
captive Jews in Babylon to their brethren at Jerusalem, and
consists of two well-marked divisions, the first of which,
extending to chap. 3:8, is, in the opinion of some, a translation
from an original Hebrew document. This part contains, after an
introductory notice, a confession of sin with prayer for
deliverance. The second part begins with an address to the covenant
people, in which they are rebuked for neglecting the teachings of
divine wisdom, and encouraged with the hope of returning prosperity
when they shall obey her voice. Chaps. 3:9-4:8. Zion is then
introduced lamenting over the desolations which God has brought
upon her and her children (chap. 4:9-4:29), and afterwards
comforting them with the hope of certain deliverance and
enlargement (chaps. 4:30-5:9). It is generally agreed that the
second part was originally written in Greek, and some think that
the same is true of the first part also.</p>
<p>18. There is another Epistle of Baruch preserved to us in the
Syriac, which is inserted in the London and Paris Polyglotts. It is
addressed to the nine and a half tribes, and "made up of
commonplaces of warning, encouragement, and exhortation." Smith's
Bib. Dict., Art. Baruch.</p>
<p>19. There is a spurious <i>Epistle of Jeremiah</i> which appears
in the Vulgate and our English version as the sixth chapter of
Baruch. It is entitled: "Copy of an epistle which Jeremiah sent to
those who were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the
Babylonians to make announcement to them, as it was commanded him
by God." It purports to be a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page359" id="page359"></a>{359}</span> warning to these captives
against the idolatrous practices which they shall witness in
Babylon, and is made up of a long discourse on the impotence of the
idols which the heathen worship, written in a rhetorical style, in
imitation of Jer. 10:1-16. Its author is supposed to have been a
Hellenistic Jew who lived towards the end of the Maccabean
period.</p>
<h3>VIII. ADDITIONS TO THE BOOK OF DANIEL.</h3>
<p>20. The Greek version of the book of Daniel, besides many
departures from the Hebrew and Chaldee original, contains three
large additions. The first of these is: <i>The Prayer of Azarias,
and the Song of the Three Children in the Fiery Furnace</i>, which
is appended to the third chapter. The second is: <i>The History of
Susanna</i>, who is exhibited as a pattern of chastity, and was
delivered from the machinations of her enemies through the wisdom
of Daniel. This is placed sometimes before the first chapter of
Daniel, and sometimes after chapter 12. The third addition is:
<i>The Story of Bel and the Dragon</i>, which stands at the end of
the book, and is falsely ascribed in the Septuagint to the prophet
Habakkuk. Its design is to show the folly of idolatry. According to
Keil, these three pieces were composed in Egypt towards the end of
the third, or the beginning of the second century before
Christ.</p>
<h3>IX. THE PRAYER OF MANASSES.</h3>
<p>21. A genuine prayer of Manasseh, king of Judah, existed at the
time when the books of Chronicles were composed. 2 Chron. 33:18,
19. But the existing prayer of the Apocrypha, though upon the whole
beautiful and appropriate, cannot claim to be a true representative
of that prayer. "The author," says Keil, "was a pious Jew who lived
at all events before Christ, though his age cannot be more
accurately determined."</p>
<h3>X. THE BOOKS OF THE MACCABEES.</h3>
<p>22. These are five in number. The first two passed from the
Greek into the early Latin versions, and thence into the Vulgate
and the English versions, and were received as canonical by the
Council of Trent. Two others are found in some manuscripts of the
Septuagint. The fifth exists only in Arabic. "If the historic order
were observed, the so-called <i>third</i> book would come first,
the fourth would be an appendix to the <i>second</i>, which would
retain its place, and the <i>first</i> would come last; but it will
be more convenient to examine the books in the order in which they
are found in the MSS., which was probably decided by some vague
tradition of their relative antiquity." Smith's Bible Dict., Art.
Maccabees. The name <i>Maccabees</i> is applied to the family and
posterity of the illustrious Jewish priest Mattathias, who
maintained a long and successful struggle <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>{360}</span> with the
Syrian kings, and finally succeeded in establishing for a period
the independence of the Jews. The origin of the term has been
variously explained; but the most common account of it is, that it
comes from a Hebrew word signifying <i>hammer</i>, so that the
adjective <i>Maccabee</i> (Greek [Greek: Makkabaios]) will denote
<i>Hammerer</i>. According to Josephus (Antiq. 12, 6, 1) Mattathias
was descended from one <i>Asmonaeus</i>: Hence the family of the
Maccabees are also called <i>Asmoneans</i>.</p>
<p>23. <i>The first book of the Maccabees.</i> This is one of the
most important of all the apocryphal books. It contains a narrative
of the long and bloody struggle of the Jews, under their Maccabean
leaders, for the preservation of their religion, and the
deliverance of the nation from the yoke of their Syrian oppressors.
The history bears the internal marks of authenticity and
credibility, being distinguished by simplicity and candor. It is
only when speaking of foreign nations that the writer falls into
some inaccuracies. These do not detract from his trustworthiness in
relating the affairs of his own nation through a period of forty
years of the most eventful character (B.C. 175-135). The book is
pervaded throughout by the Jewish spirit, and must have been
written by a Palestinian Jew. Its date is uncertain, but may
probably be placed somewhere during the government of the high
priest John Hyrcanus (B.C. 135-106). According to the testimony of
Origen, the book was originally written in Hebrew. With this agrees
its internal character; for the Greek version of it contains many
Hebraisms, as well as difficulties which are readily accounted for
upon the supposition of a Hebrew original.</p>
<p>21. <i>The second book of Maccabees.</i> This book opens with
two letters purporting to have been written by the Jews of
Palestine to their brethren in Egypt, in which the former invite
the latter to join with them in the celebration of "the feast of
tabernacles in the month Caslen," that is, the feast of dedication
established to commemorate the purification of the temple after its
pollution by Antiochus Epiphanes. To the latter of these is
appended an epitome of the five books of Jason of Cyrene,
containing the history of the Maccabean struggle, beginning with
Heliodorus' attempt to plunder the temple, about B.C. 180, and
ending with the victory of Judas Maccabeus over Nicanor, B.C. 161.
Both of the letters are regarded as spurious. The second of them
abounds in marvellous legends&mdash;how, upon the destruction of
the first temple, the sacred fire of the altar was hid in a hollow
pit without water; how, at the close of the captivity, it was found
in the form of thick water, which being by the command of Nehemiah
sprinkled on the wood of the altar and the sacrifices, there was
kindled, when the sun shone upon it, a great fire, so that all men
marvelled; how Jeremiah, at God's command, carried the tabernacle,
the ark, and the altar of incense to the mountain "which Moses
ascended and saw the heritage of God," that is, mount Nebo (Deut.
34:1), and hid them there in a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page361" id="page361"></a>{361}</span> hollow cave, where they are
to remain until the time that God shall gather his people together
again, and be gracious to them.</p>
<p>The epitome of Jason's history begins some five years earlier
than the history contained in the first book, and covers a period
of about nineteen years; so that it is partly anterior to that
history, partly supplementary, and partly parallel. Alexander's
Kitto, Art. Maccabees. The two books are entirely independent in
their sources of information; and although the second cannot lay
claim to the same degree of trustworthiness as the first, yet the
general judgment of biblical scholars is that it is, in its main
facts, authentic. But these are set forth with embellishments and
exaggerations, in which the author manifests his love for the
marvellous. Where the history of the two books is parallel, it
agrees in its general outlines, but the details are almost always
different, and sometimes they present irreconcilable discrepancies.
In its religious aspect this book is very interesting. In the
account of the martyrdom of a mother and her seven sons for their
refusal to eat swine's flesh (chap. 7) the doctrine of the
resurrection is plainly announced: "It is a thing to be desired,"
says the fourth son to the king Antiochus, "that one being put to
death by men should wait for the hope of God that he shall be again
raised up by him; but for thee there is no resurrection unto life"
(v. 14). Where Jason composed his work cannot be determined. He
cannot have lived long after the events which he describes, else he
would have taken notice of the important events that followed. The
author of the epitome contained in this book is believed to have
been a Hellenistic Jew living in Palestine, who probably wrote in
the first century before Christ.</p>
<p>25. <i>The third book of Maccabees.</i> This book does not
belong to the Maccabean age, but to the earlier time of Ptolemy
Philopator (B.C. 221-204). Its title seems to have come simply from
the similarity of its contents. It relates in a pompous and
oratorical style how Ptolemy Philopator, being enraged at his
failure to enter the sanctuary at Jerusalem, determined to wreak
his vengeance on the Jews in Egypt, and assembled them for this
purpose in the circus, that they might be trampled under foot by
drunken elephants, but was hindered by the miraculous interposition
of God; whereupon the king liberated the Jews, prepared for them a
sumptuous feast, and gave them permission to take vengeance on
their apostate countrymen. The narrative probably has a groundwork
of truth with legendary embellishments, after the manner of the
later Jews. Its author is believed to have been an Alexandrine Jew,
but his age cannot be determined. It was never admitted into the
Romish canon.</p>
<p>26. <i>The fourth book of Maccabees</i> opens with a
philosophical discussion respecting the supremacy of devout reason
over the passions, which is then illustrated by the history of the
martyrdom of Eleazar and the mother with her seven sons, an account
of which we have in 2 Macc., chaps. 6 and 7. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>{362}</span> The
author of this book was a Jew imbued with the spirit of the stoical
philosophy. It has been falsely ascribed to Josephus.</p>
<p>27. <i>The fifth book of Maccabees</i> exists only in Arabic. We
draw our notice of it from Alexander's Kitto, according to which
"it contains the history of the Jews from Heliodorus' attempt to
plunder the treasury at Jerusalem till the time when Herod revelled
in the noblest blood of the Jews;" that is, from 184-86 B.C., thus
embracing a period of 98 years. The book is a compilation made in
Hebrew, by a Jew who lived after the destruction of Jerusalem, from
ancient Hebrew memoirs or chronicles, which were written shortly
after the events transpired. In the absence of the original Hebrew,
the Arabic versions of it, printed in the Paris and London
Polyglotts, give the text upon which we must rely.</p>

<h3>FIRST DIVISION, GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>LANGUAGE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>1. In the <i>character of the original languages of the
Bible</i>, as in every thing else pertaining to the plan of
redemption, God's hand is to be reverently acknowledged. It was not
by chance, but through the provident care of Him who sees the end
from the beginning, that the writers of the Old Testament found the
Hebrew, and those of the New Testament the Greek language ready at
hand, each of them so singularly adapted to the high office
assigned to it. The stately majesty, the noble simplicity, and the
graphic vividness of the Hebrew fitted it admirably for the
<i>historical</i> portions of the Old Testament, in which, under
the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the direct intuition of God's
purposes and of the deep springs of human action superseded the
necessity of philosophical argument and deduction. The historians
of the Old Testament did not pause to argue concerning their
statements of men's motives and God's designs. They saw both with
wonderful clearness of vision; and they found in the simplicity and
directness of the Hebrew syntax, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page366" id="page366"></a>{366}</span> so far removed from all
that is involved and complex, a suitable vehicle for their simple
and direct statements of truth. How congenial the Hebrew language
is to <i>poetic</i> composition, as well in its rugged and sublime
forms as in its tender and pathetic strains, every reader of the
Old Testament in the original understands. The soul is not more at
home in the body than is sacred poetry in the language of the
covenant people. As the living spirit of the cherubim animated and
directed the wheels of the chariot in Ezekiel's vision, so does the
spirit of inspired poesy animate and direct the words and sentences
of the Hebrew language: "When the cherubim went, the wheels went by
them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from
the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. When
they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted
up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creatures was in
them." Ezek. 10:16, 17. The same characteristics fitted the Hebrew
language most perfectly for <i>prophetic</i> vision, in which the
poetic element so largely prevails.</p>
<p>2. Turning now from the Hebrew of the Old Testament to the Greek
of the New, we have a language very different in its structure;
elaborate in its inflections and syntax, delicate and subtle in its
distinctions, rich in its vocabulary, highly cultivated in every
department of writing, and flexible in an eminent degree; being
thus equally adapted to every variety of style&mdash;plain
unadorned narrative, impassioned oratory, poetry of every form,
philosophical discussion, and severe logical reasoning: in a word,
a language every way fitted to the wants of the gospel, which is
given not for the infancy of the world but for its mature age, and
which deals not so much with the details of particulars as with
great principles, which require for their full comprehension the
capacity of abstraction and generalization. In the historical
records of the Old Testament, and in its poetic and prophetic
parts, the Hebrew language was altogether at home. But for such
compositions as the epistle to the Romans the Greek offered a more
perfect medium; and here, as everywhere else God's providence took
care that the founders of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page367" id="page367"></a>{367}</span> Christian church should be
furnished in the most complete manner.</p>
<p>3. We find, accordingly, that centuries before our Lord's
advent, preparation began to be made in the providence of God for
this change in the language of the inspired writings. One result of
the Babylonish captivity was that Hebrew ceased to be the
vernacular of the masses of the people, and a form of Aramaean took
its place. Chap. 14, No. 4. After the return of the Jews from this
same captivity and their re&euml;stablishment in their own land,
the spirit of prophecy was also withdrawn, and the canon of the Old
Testament brought to a close. Thus the cessation of Hebrew as the
spoken language of the people, and the withdrawal of the spirit of
prophecy were contemporaneous events. The canon was locked up in
the sacred language, and the <i>interpreter</i> took the place of
the <i>prophet</i>. "The providential change of language suggested
a general limit within which the voice of inspiration might be
heard, as the fearful chastisements of the captivity turned men's
minds to the old Scriptures with a devotion unknown before."
Westcott's Introduc. to the Study of the Gospels, chap. 1.</p>
<p>4. But the conquests of Alexander the Great (B.C. 334-323)
brought the Greek language and the Greek civilization into Asia and
Egypt, as a sure leaven destined to leaven the whole mass. To this
influence the Jews could not remain insensible. It reached even
Palestine, where they naturally clung most tenaciously to the
Aramaean language and to the customs of their fathers. But out of
Palestine, where the Jews were dispersed in immense numbers, it
operated more immediately; especially in Egypt, whose metropolis
Alexandria was, after the age of Alexander its founder, one of the
chief seats of Grecian learning. To the Jews of Alexandria the
Greek language was vernacular. By them was executed, as we have
seen, under the patronage of the Egyptian king, the first version
ever made of the Hebrew Scriptures, namely, that called the
Septuagint (Chap. 16, Nos. 1-7), which was begun, if not completed,
in the latter part of the third century before Christ. Though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id=
"page368"></a>{368}</span> this version encountered bitter
opposition on the part of the unbelieving Jews <i>after</i> the
establishment of the Christian church, in consequence of the
effective use made of it against them by Christian writers, it was
received from its first appearance and onward with general favor.
The Hellenistic Jews&mdash;those using the Greek language and
conforming themselves to Grecian civilization&mdash;made constant
use of it, and the knowledge of it was very widely diffused beyond
the boundaries of Egypt. In our Saviour's day it was in very
general use, as the abundant quotations from it in the New
Testament show; and it must have contributed largely to the spread
of the knowledge of the Greek language among the Jewish people in
and out of Palestine. Though the Roman empire succeeded to that of
the Greeks, the Roman could not supplant the more polished Greek
tongue, with its immense and varied literature. On the contrary,
the Greek language penetrated into Italy, and especially into Rome,
the metropolis of the civilized world, where, in our Saviour's day,
Greek literature was in high repute, and the Greek language was
very generally understood. Thus, in the good providence of God, the
writers of the New Testament, also, found ready at hand a language
singularly adapted to their service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biblical scholars have noticed the significant fact that of the
long list of names in the sixteenth chapter of Romans, the greater
number belongs to the Greek language, not to the Latin. "The
flexibility of the Greek language gained for it in ancient time a
general currency similar to that which French enjoys in modern
Europe; but with this important difference, that Greek was not only
the language of educated men, but also the language of the masses
in the great centres of commerce." Westcott in Smith's Bible Dict.,
Art. Hellenist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Respecting the <i>character</i> of the New Testament Greek
there was in former times much controversy, often accompanied with
unnecessary heat and bitterness. One class of writers seemed to
think that the honor of the New Testament was involved in their
ability to show the classic purity and elegance of its style; as
if, forsooth, the Spirit of inspiration could only <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>{369}</span> address
men through the medium of language conformed to the classic
standard of propriety. Another class went to the opposite extreme,
speaking in exaggerated terms of the Hebraisms and solecisms of the
New Testament writers. The truth lies between these extremes. The
style of the New Testament is neither classical nor barbarous. Its
characteristics are strictly conformable to the history of its
origin. (1.) Its basis is not the Greek of Plato and Xenophon, but
the so-called Hellenic or common dialect which arose in the age of
Alexander the Great, when "the previously distinct dialects, spoken
by the various sections of the Hellenic nation, were blended into a
popular spoken language." Winer, Gram, of the New Test., sec. 2.
The Alexandrine Jews doubtless learned it not so much from books as
from the daily intercourse of life, and it probably had its
provincial peculiarities in Alexandria and the adjacent region.
(2.) In Jewish usage this common Greek dialect received an Hebraic
coloring from the constant use of the Septuagint version, which is
a literal rendering of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, of course
with the retention of many Hebrew idioms. Only such thorough Greek
scholars as Josephus and Philo could rise above this influence. The
New Testament writers manifest its power in different degrees; for,
as it respects Hebraisms, they do not by any means stand on a
common level. (3.) As the Aramaic&mdash;the so-called
Syro-Chaldaic&mdash;was the language of the mass of the people, the
style of the New Testament writers received a tinge from this also.
(4.) More than all, the style of the New Testament receives a
peculiar impress from the fact that the authors were Jews writing
under the full influence of a Jewish education and a Jewish faith,
with the superadded element of Christianity. It is the phenomenon
of the spirit and thoughts of Jewish Christians embodied in the
language of Greece; and this at once separates the writings of the
New Testament by a wide interval from all purely classic
compositions. The apostolic writers imposed on the Greek language
an arduous task, that of expressing ideas foreign to the
conceptions of the most cultivated <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page370" id="page370"></a>{370}</span> among the pagan authors;
ideas partly common to the old Jewish and the Christian religions,
partly peculiar to Christianity. This could only be done by giving
to existing terms a new and higher meaning, whereby they assumed a
technical character wholly unknown to the classic writers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Compare particularly the words: <i>works</i> (<i>to work</i>,
Rom. 4:4), <i>faith</i>, <i>to believe in Christ</i>, or <i>to
believe</i> absolutely, <i>confession</i>, <i>righteousness</i>,
<i>to be justified</i>, <i>to be chosen</i>, <i>the called</i>,
<i>the chosen</i>, <i>the saints</i> (for Christians),
<i>edification</i> and <i>to edify</i> in a figurative sense,
<i>apostle</i>, <i>to publish the good tidings</i> and to
<i>publish</i> absolutely for Christian preaching, the adoption of
<i>baptisma</i>, <i>baptism</i>, for <i>Christian baptism</i>,
perhaps <i>to break bread</i> for the <i>holy repast</i> (the
<i>Agape</i> with the communion), <i>the world</i>, <i>the
flesh</i>, <i>fleshly</i>, in the known theological sense," etc.
Winer's Gram, of the New Test., sec. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. From all the abovenamed causes the language of the New
Testament received a form differing widely from the classic style,
but admirably adapted to the high office assigned to it. To those
who study the New Testament in the original, the peculiarities of
its language offer a wide and interesting field of inquiry. But for
the common reader the above hints will be sufficient.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id=
"page371"></a>{371}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>EXTERNAL FORM OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>1. The writings of the New Testament fall into three <i>main
divisions</i>; the <i>historical</i>, the <i>epistolary</i>, and
the <i>prophetical</i>, the latter including only the Apocalypse.
This distinction is not to be understood in an absolute sense;
since, as every reader knows, there are prophetical passages in the
historical books, and both historical and prophetical in the
epistles; but it gives with accuracy the general character of each
division. In outward form the Apocalypse is epistolary, being
addressed, with the apostolic greeting, to the seven churches of
Asia, and containing messages to each. But its contents, after the
first three chapters, are so wholly prophetical, that it is
entitled to stand by itself in any general division.</p>
<p>2. The <i>order</i> of these <i>main divisions</i> is natural
and appropriate. The gospel, as was remarked at the outset (Chap.
1, No. 1), is not a mere system of philosophy or ethics, but rests
on a basis of historic facts. On these its whole system of
doctrines and duties is built; so that to destroy the foundation
would be to destroy the superstructure also. It is suitable,
therefore, that the record of the facts should hold the first
place. The apostolic epistles, which unfold the doctrines and
duties involved in the gospel, and make a practical application of
them to all the manifold relations of life, naturally follow the
historic record. The mighty system of prophecies contained in the
book of Revelation, which stretches over the whole future history
of the church to the end of time, forms an appropriate close to the
entire collection of writings.</p>
<p>3. Equally appropriate is the order of the two
<i>subdivisions</i> of the historic part&mdash;first, the four
Gospels, containing the history of our Lord's life; secondly, the
Acts of the Apostles. In the general arrangement of the epistles,
the thirteen which bear <span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id=
"page372"></a>{372}</span> the name of Paul stand first in order.
The seven so-called catholic epistles occupy the last place.
Intermediate between these two subdivisions stands the epistle to
the Hebrews, which is anonymous, though generally ascribed to Paul.
The epistles which bear the name of Paul fall into two
groups&mdash;nine addressed to <i>Christian churches</i>, which
occupy the first place; then four to <i>particular persons</i>. Of
these last, the first three, being addressed to Timothy and Titus,
the apostle's companions in travel and in the gospel ministry, are
appropriately named from their contents the <i>pastoral</i>
epistles. The letter to Philemon, a private member of the church in
Colosse, naturally stands last of all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We add from Bleek (Introduc. to New Test., secs. 18 and 254) the
following additional notices:</p>
<p>The present order of the Gospels is very ancient. Only in some
manuscripts of the Old Latin version, in one Greco-Latin manuscript
(the so-called Codex Bezae or Cambridge Codex), and in the
manuscript of the Gothic version, the two apostles Matthew and John
stand first; then the two companions of apostles, Luke and Mark, or
sometimes Mark and Luke. In the very ancient Curetonian-Syrian
manuscript the order is Matthew, Mark, John, Luke.</p>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles stand in some manuscripts after the
Pauline or after the catholic epistles.</p>
<p>In the oldest Greek manuscripts, and generally in the greatest
number of Greek manuscripts which contain the whole New Testament,
the catholic epistles stand before the Pauline; an arrangement
which some modern editors, as Lachmann and Tischendorf, have
followed. In many manuscripts, the oldest Greek included, the
epistle to the Hebrews stands after 2 Thessalonians, immediately
before the pastoral epistles. Luther placed together, at the end of
his version, the epistles to the Hebrews, the epistles of James and
Jude, and the Apocalypse. But this arrangement rested on no
authority of manuscripts. It was only an expression of his private
judgment respecting their canonical authority, which he placed
below that of the other books of the New Testament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. We have seen (Chap. 13, No. 4) that in the arrangement of the
books of the Old Testament, the order of time is followed only very
partially. The same is true respecting the order of books in the
New Testament, a fact which the biblical student ought always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id=
"page373"></a>{373}</span> to bear in mind. If we look to the
several divisions and subdivisions of the New Testament writings,
it is obvious that the arrangement is not chronological. It is
generally admitted that the Gospel according to John was written
after the death of Peter and Paul; consequently, after the Acts of
the Apostles (which were written during the life of Paul, Chap. 5,
No. 5), after all the Pauline epistles, and probably after all the
Catholic epistles except those which are ascribed to John himself.
The Acts of the Apostles, again, are of later date than several of
Paul's epistles. Finally, neither the Pauline nor the catholic
epistles are arranged in chronological order. See below, Chap. 30,
No. 6. The intelligent student of the New Testament will avail
himself of all the means at his command to ascertain the date,
proximately at least, of each particular book; that he may thus
connect it with the development of Christianity in the threefold
line of doctrine, practice, and polity.</p>
<p>5. The present distinction of large letters (capitals) and small
did not come into use before the ninth century. In conformity with
ancient usage, the manuscripts executed before this period are
written in large disconnected letters (the so-called
<i>uncial</i>), without any marks of interpunction, or even
division of words. This is called the <i>continuous writing</i>
(<i>scriptio continua</i>), in which it is left to the reader's
discretion to make the necessary division of words and sentences;
as if the beginning of the Gospel according to John were written
thus in Latin and English:</p>
<table cellspacing="10" summary="Continuous script">

</tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>Writers before our Saviour's time do indeed speak of signs of
interpunction; but they seem to have been in use only in the
grammatical schools, and with a limited application to certain
doubtful passages in the ancient writers. That they were unknown in
the older manuscripts of the New Testament is evident from the
discussions that arose among the church fathers respecting the
right division of certain passages, in which they never appeal to
the authority of manuscripts, but argue solely from the nature of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id=
"page374"></a>{374}</span> the connection. The reader may see a
collection of examples in Hug's Introduction to the New Testament,
&sect; 43, where are also some curious examples of the wrong
division of words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. To obviate the inconvenience of this continuous mode of
writing, there was introduced, about the middle of the fifth
century, what is called the <i>stichometrical</i> mode (Greek
<i>stichos</i>, a <i>row</i> or <i>line</i>, and <i>metron</i>, a
<i>measure</i>). This consisted in arranging in a single line only
so many words as could be read, consistently with the sense, at a
single inspiration.</p>
<p>The invention of stichometry has been generally ascribed to
Euthalius, a deacon in Alexandria, who, in the year 458, set forth
a copy of Paul's epistles stichometrically arranged; but Tregelles
is inclined to the opinion that he borrowed the system from an
earlier writer, Pamphilus the martyr. However this may be, the
original conception doubtless came from the stichometry of Hebrew
poetry. Hug (&sect; 44) and Tregelles (Horne's Introduct., vol. 4,
chap. 4) give an example in Greek from a fragment of the Pauline
epistles. This example (Titus 2:2, 3), when literally translated
into English according to the Greek order of words, reads as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THEAGEDMENTOBESOBER<br />
GRAVE<br />
SOBERMINDED<br />
SOUNDINTHEFAITH<br />
INLOVE<br />
INPATIENCE<br />
THEAGEDWOMENLIKEWISE<br />
INBEHAVIORASBECOMESHOLYWOMEN<br />
NOTSLANDERERS<br />
NOTGIVENTOMUCHWINE<br />
TEACHERSOFGOODTHINGS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the design of stichometry was not interpunction according
to the connection of thought, yet it seems to have led to this
result. The expensiveness of this mode of writing, owing to the
waste of parchment, naturally suggested the idea of separating the
lines by a simple point, thus:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id=
"page375"></a>{375}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>THEAGEDMENTOBESOBER. GRAVE.<br />
SOBERMINDED. SOUNDINTHEFAITH.<br />
INLOVE. INPATIENCE. THEAGED<br />
WOMENLIKEWISE. INBEHAVIORAS<br />
BECOMETHHOLYWOMEN. NOTSLAN<br />
DERERS. NOTGIVENTOMUCHWINE.<br />
TEACHERSOFGOODTHINGS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As these divisions were mainly <i>rhythmical</i>, and often
broke the true connection of thought, men sought to introduce a
more logical system of interpunction. Thus was laid the foundation
of our present system; which, however, was not perfected till after
the invention of the art of printing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the opinion of some, the use of the dot, at least to some
extent, was earlier than stichometry. From the eighth or ninth
century punctuation in manuscripts became more common and
systematic. In <i>cursive</i> manuscripts&mdash;those that employ
the running hand with large and small letters and the separation of
the words, a style of writing that became the common one from the
ninth century and onward&mdash;punctuation also prevails, though
not according to any one established system. Tregelles, <i>ubi
sup</i>. Various other particulars interesting to those who study
the Greek text in the original, as those relating to the accents,
the smooth and rough breathing, and the iota subscript, are here
omitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. We come next to consider the <i>ancient divisions</i> made in
the <i>contents</i> of the sacred text. <i>Chapters</i> are very
early mentioned, as by Tertullian and Dionysius of Alexandria. But
it is uncertain whether any thing more is meant than parts or
sections of given contents. The earliest formal division of the
four gospels that has come down to us consists of the <i>Ammonian
sections</i> (Greek <i>kephalaia</i>, <i>heads</i> or
<i>chapters</i>), so named from Ammonius of Alexandria, who, about
the middle of the third century, prepared a harmony of the four
gospels&mdash;<i>the Gospel by four</i>, as Eusebius calls it. His
plan was, to arrange in the order of Matthew the parallel passages
side by side, interpolating those that were wanting in Matthew. To
this end, he divided each of the gospels into sections the length
of which was very various, being wholly determined by the
parallelisms of the other gospels. Of these sections Matthew
contained <span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id=
"page376"></a>{376}</span> 355; Mark, 234 (in Wordsworth's Greek
Testament, 236 are given); Luke, 342; John, 231 (in Wordsworth's
Greek Testament, 232). The infelicity of this arrangement was that,
with the exception of the first gospel, the true order of the
evangelists was broken up&mdash;"The train of sequence of the three
was destroyed in respect to the orderly course of reading," as
Eusebius says (Letter to Carpianus, given in Wordsworth's Greek
Testament).</p>
<p>To remedy this evil, Eusebius, bishop of C&aelig;sarea, in the
following century connected with these Ammonian sections his <i>ten
canons</i>. These are ten tables, arranged according to the order
of Matthew, or where sections are wanting in Matthew, according to
the order of the next evangelist that contains them, in such a way
as to show at a glance what sections of the other evangelists
answer to any given section of that gospel which stands first in
order in each canon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numbering the four gospels in order&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4&mdash;the
ten canons of Eusebius contain as follows:</p>

<p>A couple of examples will make this matter plain. Turning to
what is now the beginning of the thirteenth chapter of Matthew, we
find (the Greek numerals being exchanged for those in common use)
the sign 131/II that is, the 131st Ammonian section of Matthew with
the second canon of Eusebius. Turning to the table of the second
canon, we find, corresponding to the 131st section of Matthew, the
36th of Mark and the 76th of Luke, which contain the parallel
passages concerning the sower. Again, connected with Mark 1:23, is
the sign, 14/VIII whence we learn, by reference to the eighth
canon, that the fourteenth section of Mark answers to the 25th of
Luke. By a repetition of the canons as often as necessary, so as to
allow each gospel in turn to take the lead, Wordsworth has greatly
facilitated the work of comparing parallel passages.</p>
<p>"The Codex Vaticanus B, contains a distribution into sections
wholly peculiar. Of these, St. Matthew contains 170, St. Mark 61,
etc. The length of these divisions is very unequal; the
<i>sense</i> being the reason of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page377" id="page377"></a>{377}</span> breaks occurring when they
do. In the gospels, at least, the sections are perhaps the best
that were ever devised; and this system of capitulary division is
probably the earliest of which we have the means of knowing any
thing." Horne's Introduction, vol. 4, chap. 4, revised edition,
1860.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>8. Different from the Ammonian-Eusebian sections, and later in
their origin, are the divisions of the gospels called
<i>titles</i>, because each of them received a title from one of
the first or principal subjects mentioned in it. They are thought
to have been connected with the public reading of the gospels. Of
these, Matthew contains 68; Mark, 48; Luke, 83; John, 18. They are,
therefore, larger than the Ammonian sections, and resemble more
nearly our modern chapters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These <i>titles</i> are called by the Latins <i>briefs</i>
(<i>breves</i>), and the tables of their contents <i>breviaries</i>
(<i>breviaria</i>). They did not come into common use before the
fifth century, and are commonly annexed to manuscripts along with
the Ammonian-Eusebian sections. But they are the only divisions
known to some of the church fathers, as Euthymius and
Theophylact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>9. The divisions of the other books of the New Testament are
thought to be of later origin. Euthalius introduced into a copy,
which he sent to Athanasius the younger, divisions called chapters.
He has sometimes been considered the author of those in the Acts
and catholic epistles; but he probably took them from an older
source. Those in the Pauline epistles he expressly ascribed to "one
of the wisest and most Christ-loving of our fathers." He also gave
headings to the chapters, descriptive of their contents, but
collected from previous sources. The Apocalypse was divided into
twenty-four larger sections and seventy-two smaller&mdash;a work
ascribed to Andreas of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia. Tregelles, in
Horne's Introduction, vol. 4, chap. 4.</p>
<p>10. Our present division of chapters was made in the thirteenth
century, by Cardinal Hugo, from whom proceeded also that in the Old
Testament. It was first introduced into the Latin copies, and
afterwards into the Greek. Our present division of verses was made
by Robert Stephens, in 1551. It <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page378" id="page378"></a>{378}</span> was preceded by some
earlier divisions, as that of Pagninus, in which the verses were
longer than those of Stephens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distinct from all the above divisions are the
<i>church-lessons</i>, made very early, in imitation of the Jewish
Haphtaroth, or sections from the prophets. Chap. 13, No. 6. The
beginning of these seems to have been in special selections for the
church festivals. But the usage was afterwards extended so as to
include selections for all the Sabbaths and feast-days of the year.
Hence from the fifth century and onward the whole New Testament was
no longer publicly read, as in the primitive days of Christianity,
according to the free judgment of those who conducted the
church-services; but these selected sections (<i>pericopae</i>).
Collections of these lessons were called by the general name of
<i>lectionaries</i> (lectionaria). Those from the gospels or Acts
and epistles received special names indicative of their contents.
See Bleek, &sect; 265; Horne's Introduction, vol. 4, chap. 4,
end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>11. From the above brief survey, it is manifest that none of the
external divisions of the sacred text rest on any divine authority.
They are the work of uninspired men, and are to be treated
accordingly. For <i>convenience of reference</i>, a division of the
Scriptures into chapters and verses is indispensable; and we may
well rest contented with that which now prevails, though it cannot
claim perfection. But in the <i>interpretation</i> of the inspired
word we must go behind human divisions, carefully inquiring after
the true connection of thought, according to the acknowledged laws
of interpretation. To give one example out of many, we must not
infer that the last verse of the eleventh chapter of the book of
Revelation belongs to the <i>preceding</i> and not the
<i>following</i> context, because of its separation from the latter
in the division of chapters; but we must determine its true
connection independently of this division.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very good arrangement is that of <i>Paragraph Bibles</i>, in
which the distinctions of chapter and verse are thrown into the
margin, the text being broken into longer or shorter sections
according to the true course of thought. Yet this mode of division
also is human, and cannot be infallible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>12. The <i>titles</i> of the several books of the New Testament
did not proceed immediately from the authors themselves. In form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id=
"page379"></a>{379}</span> they present some diversity; for
example: <i>The Gospel according to Matthew</i>; <i>according to
Matthew</i>; <i>the holy Gospel according to Matthew</i>, etc., the
shorter and simpler titles being, as a rule, the more ancient. For
substance, however, the different forms are the same. They
represent the ancient church tradition, and are of very high
authority. The <i>subscriptions</i>, on the other hand, which stand
at the end of the epistles of Paul, that to the Hebrews
included&mdash;are confessedly the work of later copyists. They are
of no authority, and are sometimes manifestly incorrect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>THE NEW TESTAMENT TEXT AND ITS HISTORY.</h3>
<p>The history of the New Testament text naturally falls into two
main divisions, that of the <i>manuscript</i> text, and that of the
<i>printed</i> text. A few remarks will be added on the
<i>principles of textual criticism</i>. <i>See PLATES at the
beginning of this book</i>.</p>
<p>[Transcriber's Note: The Plates are at the end of this
e-book.]</p>
<h3>I. THE MANUSCRIPT TEXT.</h3>
<p>1. The preservation of the primitive text of the gospels from
all essential corruptions, additions, and mutilations has already
been shown at some length (Part 1, Chap. 3). The same line of
argument applies substantially to the other books of the New
Testament. Though the text of different books varies in respect to
purity, there is no ground for supposing that if we had the
autographs of the evangelists and other sacred writers, they would
present to us a gospel differing in any essential particular from
that which we now possess. We should see in them the same glorious
Saviour, and the same holy system of doctrines and duties.</p>
<p>2. But it has not pleased God to interpose in a miraculous way
for the purpose of keeping the primitive text in a state of
immaculate purity. He has left it subject to those common
influences which produce what are called <i>various readings</i> in
all works that are perpetuated from age to age by transcription.
Compared indeed with any other ancient writings, the text of the
New Testament has immensely the advantage in regard to
uncorruptness of preservation and means of verification. This
arises from the early multiplication of copies, as well as from the
high value attached by the primitive churches to their sacred
books, and their consequent zeal for their uncorrupt preservation.
But the same multiplication of copies which constitutes a sure
guarantee against essential mutilations and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>{381}</span>
corruptions increases also the number of various readings. Suppose,
for example, that of two books equal in size the second has been,
from the first, copied a hundred-fold oftener than the first. It is
plain that, while the means of ascertaining and verifying the true
text of the second will abound, the number of variations among the
different manuscripts will abound also. The greater the number of
copies, the greater will be the number of various readings, but
this will make the true text not more but less uncertain; for by
diligent collation a text may be produced which, though not
absolutely immaculate, is very near to the primitive autograph, and
which can be certainly known to agree with it in every essential
respect. God does not rain down upon men bread and raiment from
heaven, as he could do with infinite ease; but he imposes upon them
the necessity of gaining both by hard labor. "In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread" is the stern law. God does not
miraculously communicate to the missionary who goes to Syria or
India or China a knowledge of the vernacular in his field of labor;
but he must learn it by years of patient study. And when he begins
the work of translating, God does not keep him in a supernatural
way from all errors. He must find out and correct his errors by the
diligent use of the means at his disposal. Just so it is the will
of God that we should have a pure text of the New
Testament&mdash;pure in a critical sense&mdash;not without hard
labor, but by years of patient toil in the study and collation of
the abundant materials which his good providence has preserved for
us.</p>
<p>3. <i>Various readings</i> have arisen in the manuscripts of the
New Testament, as elsewhere, from the mistakes, and sometimes from
the unskilful corrections of the copyists and those subsequently
employed to compare and correct the copies. They are commonly
divided into the three classes of <i>substitutions</i>,
<i>insertions</i>, and <i>omissions</i>.</p>
<p><i>Substitutions</i> from similarity of sound would naturally
arise among the vowels when, as was sometimes the case, the copyist
wrote from dictation, being guided by the ear instead of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id=
"page382"></a>{382}</span> eye. Most of these, however, are mere
matters of orthography. It is only when they affect the sense that
they come under the head of various readings. Synonymous words, or
those of kindred meaning, are frequently put for one another, or
the order of words is altered; sometimes a different word is made
through inadvertence by the change of a single letter or a couple
of letters; compound words are interchanged with simple; contracted
words are confounded with each other; plainer or more grammatical
readings are substituted for those that are difficult or less
grammatical, etc. Especially are parallel passages in one writer
altered, so as to be brought into conformity with the same in
another.</p>
<p><i>Insertions</i> are the most frequent mode of variation. The
copyist fills out the text of his author from a parallel passage,
inserts marginal notations in the text, repeats clauses through
inadvertence, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of amplification from parallel passages many undoubted examples
could be given. A single one must suffice. In Acts 9:5, the words,
<i>It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks</i>, have been
added from Acts 26:14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most fruitful source of <i>omissions</i> is the similar
termination of two adjacent words, lines, or sentences, causing the
eye of the copyist to overlook the word, line, or sentence
intervening between the two similar endings. The same error may be
caused by the circumstance of two sentences beginning in the same
way. It should be remembered that in the ancient manuscripts the
text was written continuously in uncial&mdash;that is,
capital&mdash;letters, without any division between the words,
which made it more difficult for the copyist to follow the
manuscript before him, and for both the copyist and collater to
discover the errors made in transcription.</p>
<p>By far the greatest number of various readings had their origin
in simple inadvertence. Some of them, however, are due to unskilful
criticism; as when the copyist or the corrector sought to bring a
passage in one writer into more exact agreement with the
corresponding passage in another, to supply <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>{383}</span> supposed
deficiencies or correct supposed errors in his copy, or to
substitute smoother and more grammatical forms of expression.
Wilful falsifications in the interest of a particular sect or party
cannot with any show of justice be imputed to the men who have
perpetuated to us the text of the New Testament.</p>
<p>4. The <i>materials</i> for textual criticism are much more
abundant in the case of the New Testament than of the Old. A vast
mass of manuscripts has been collected from different and distant
regions, dating from the fourth century and onward. Of these, part
are in the original Greek, part in ancient versions, or bilingual,
that is, containing the original and a version of it side by side.
In addition to these are the quotations of the early fathers, which
are so abundant that a large part of the New Testament text might
be collected from them alone. The question of the history of the
text, as gathered from this rich mass of materials, is very
interesting, but is foreign to the plan of the present work. To
give even a history of the controversies respecting the proper
classification of the manuscripts of the New Testament according to
their characteristic readings would require a volume, and the
question must be regarded as yet unsettled. There are, however,
some general results, a few of the more important of which are here
given from Tregelles (in Horne, vol. 4, chap: 8).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variations in the form of the sacred text are not due to any
general recensions or revisions by ecclesiastical authority, but
arose gradually from the causes above considered (No. 3). These
variations exhibit such gradations of text that it is impossible to
draw definite lines of classification, without admitting so many
exceptions as almost to destroy the application of such a
system.</p>
<p>There is a general difference in characteristic readings between
the more ancient manuscripts, versions, and citations, and the
copies of general circulation in more recent times. This gives rise
to the general line of demarcation between the <i>more ancient</i>
and the <i>more recent</i> texts; each of these two classes,
however, having, in turn, its own points of difference among the
texts belonging to it.</p>
<p>The more ancient manuscripts, versions, and citations which we
possess range themselves under what we know from their combined
testimony <span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id=
"page384"></a>{384}</span> to be the more ancient text. Among the
manuscripts and documents so allied there are such shades of
difference and characteristic peculiarities, that the versions and
manuscripts might be easily contemplated as ramifying into two
subclasses.</p>
<p>The most ancient documents in general are sufficiently
dissimilar to enable us to regard their testimony, when combined,
as cumulative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Respecting the materials for writing in ancient
times&mdash;papyrus and parchment, afterwards paper made from linen
or cotton; the form of manuscripts&mdash;the roll with papyrus, and
the book-form with leaves when parchment was used; the use of
<i>palimpsests</i>; the <i>uncial</i> and <i>cursive</i> styles of
writing; and the means of determining the age of manuscripts, see
in Chap. 3, No. 2. The existing manuscripts have been all numbered
and catalogued. The custom since the time of Wetstein has been to
mark the uncial manuscripts by capital letters, and the cursives by
numbers or small letters. We append a brief notice of a few of the
more celebrated manuscripts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four very ancient and important manuscripts, all of
which originally contained the entire Greek Bible of the Old and
New Testament, and which belong to a time when the arrangements of
Euthalius, especially his stichometrical mode of writing (Chap. 25,
Nos. 6-9), had either not been introduced or not come into common
use. These are the following:</p>
<p>(1.) The <i>Codex Vaticanus</i>, <i>Vatican manuscript</i>,
marked by the letter B, and so called from the Vatican library at
Rome to which it belongs. It is written continuously (without any
division of words) on very fine vellum&mdash;one of the marks of
high antiquity&mdash;in small but neat uncial letters, very much
like those of the manuscript rolls of Herculaneum, and has three
columns to the page, which is of the quarto size. Originally it had
at the end of particular sections a small empty space of the
breadth of a letter or half a letter, but no ornamental capitals,
marks of punctuation, or accents, though some of these have been
added by later hands. The divisions into sections made by the empty
spaces above named are peculiar to this codex, not agreeing with
those of any other system. Of these Matthew has 170; Mark, 62 (so
says Cardinal Mai, but others say 72 or 61); Luke, 152; John, 80.
Most of the books have also brief titles and subscriptions. The
manuscript contained originally the whole Bible, the Apocrypha
included, as also the epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. The
order of the books in the New Testament, if entire, would be the
same as in the Alexandrine manuscript, the Catholic epistles
preceding the Pauline, and the epistle to the Hebrews coming in
between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Timothy. See <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>{385}</span> below. At
present the Old Testament wants the greater part of Genesis and a
part of the Psalms. In the New Testament the epistle to Philemon,
the three pastoral epistles, the latter part of the epistle to the
Hebrews, and the Apocalypse are wanting. This manuscript is
generally referred to the fourth century. Its authority is very
high, but through the jealousy of its Roman conservators it has
been of late years, for all practical purposes, inaccessible to
biblical scholars. Cardinal Mai's edition of it in 1858, and the
revision of this in 1859, are unreliable. Tischendorf has published
an edition of the New Testament part of it. <i>No. (3) PLATE
II</i>.</p>
<p>(2.) The <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i>, <i>Sinai manuscript</i>,
designated by Tischendorf, its discoverer, by the Hebrew letter
<i>aleph</i> ([Hebrew: A]). One of the most interesting events of
the present century, in the department of biblical science, is the
very unexpected discovery of a complete manuscript of the New
Testament, belonging, as is generally agreed, to the fourth
century; therefore as old, at least, as the Vatican manuscript,
perhaps older, and of very high authority in biblical criticism. In
a visit to Mount Sinai in 1844, Tischendorf had found at the
convent of St. Catharine on Mount Sinai forty-three beautiful
parchment leaves belonging to a manuscript of the Septuagint not
before known to biblical scholars. In a subsequent visit to the
same convent in February, 1859, it was his high privilege to find
of the same manuscript all the Greek New Testament entire, part of
the Old, the so-called epistle of Barnabas, and part of the writing
called the Shepherd of Hermas, the whole contained in one hundred
and thirty-two thousand columnar lines, written on three hundred
and forty-six leaves. This precious manuscript Tischendorf managed
to obtain for the emperor Alexander of Russia as the great patron
of the Greek church, and it is now at St. Petersburg. It is written
on parchment of a fine quality in large plain uncial letters, with
four columns to a page. It contains, as is commonly the case with
ancient manuscripts, revisions and so-called corrections by a later
hand; but, as it proceeded from the pen of the original writer, it
had neither ornamented capitals, accents, nor divisions of words or
sentences. The style of writing is plain, and every thing about it
bears the marks of high antiquity. The order of the books is as
follows: (1) the gospels; (2) the epistles of Paul, that to the
Hebrews included, which stands after 2 Thessalonians; (3) the Acts
of the Apostles; (4) the Catholic epistles; (5) the Apocalypse. It
has the Ammonian sections and Eusebian canons, but whether from the
first or a subsequent hand is doubtful. A splendid edition of this
Codex was published at St. Petersburg in 1862, which seeks to
preserve with the greatest possible accuracy the form of writing,
columns, corrections, etc. The Leipsic edition is adapted to
popular use. <i>See No. (1), PLATE I</i>.</p>
<p>(3.) We will consider next in order the <i>Codex
Alexandrinus</i>, <i>Alexandrine manuscript</i>, placed first in
the list of uncial manuscripts, and accordingly <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>{386}</span> marked A.
It is now in the British Museum, London. In the year 1628 it was
sent as a present to Charles I., king of England, by Cyrillus
Lucaris, patriarch of Constantinople, by whom it was brought from
Alexandria in Egypt, where Cyrillus had formerly held the same
office. Hence the name Alexandrine. Cyrillus himself, in a notice
attached to it, says that tradition represented a noble Egyptian
woman of the fourth century named Thecla as the writer of it (an
Arabic subscription makes her to have been Thecla the martyr).
These external notices are not so reliable as the internal marks,
all of which show it to be of a great age. Some assign it to the
fourth century, but it is more commonly assigned to the fifth, and
Egypt is generally regarded as the place where it was written. It
is on parchment in uncial letters, without divisions of words,
accents, or breathings, and with only occasional marks of
interpunction&mdash;a dot to indicate a division in the sense. The
lines are arranged in two columns, and the sections begin with
large letters, placed a little to the left of the
column&mdash;outside the measure of the column. The order of the
books is: (1) the gospels; (2) the Acts of the Apostles; (3) the
Catholic epistles; (4) the epistles of Paul, with that to the
Hebrews between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Timothy; (5) the Apocalypse.
In the gospels, the Ammonian sections with the Eusebian canons are
indicated, and at the top of the pages the larger sections or
<i>titles</i>. In the Old Testament it is defective in part of the
Psalms. In the New it wants all of Matthew as far as chap. 25:6;
also from John 6:50 to 8:52; and from 2 Cor. 4:13 to 12:6. It has
appended at the end the genuine letter of Clement of Rome to the
Corinthians, and a fragment of a second spurious letter. To these
apocryphal additions we owe the preservation of the Apocalypse in
an entire state. Until the discovery of the Sinai codex, the
Alexandrine exhibited the text of the New Testament in far the most
entire state of all the uncial manuscripts. <i>See No. (2), PLATE
I</i>.</p>
<p>(4) The fourth manuscript of this group is the celebrated
palimpsest called <i>Codex Ephraemi</i>, <i>Ephraem manuscript</i>,
preserved in the Imperial library of Paris, and marked in the list
of uncials with the letter C. Originally it contained the whole of
the New Testament, and apparently the Old also, elegantly written
on thin vellum, with a single column to a page. The writing is
continuous, without accents or breathings, and the letters are
rather larger than in the Alexandrian manuscript, the first letter
of each section being of larger size than the rest, and standing,
as in that manuscript, a little to the left of the column. The
Ammonian sections stand in the margin, but without the Eusebian
canons. The gospels were preceded by the list of <i>titles</i>, or
larger sections, of which those of Luke and John alone are
preserved. The titles and subscriptions are short and simple. The
date of the manuscript is supposed to be the first half of the
fifth century. It has undergone corrections at the hand of at least
two persons, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id=
"page387"></a>{387}</span> possibly a third. These can be readily
distinguished from the original writing. The critical authority of
this codex is very high. Tregelles (in Horne, vol. 4, chap. 13)
places it next to the Vatican manuscript.</p>
<p>A few words on its history. About the thirteenth century, being
regarded as a worn-out and obsolete manuscript, the vellum on which
it was written was taken for a new purpose, that of receiving the
Greek works of Ephraem the Syrian saint, a celebrated theologian of
the old Syrian church, who flourished in the fourth century. "For
this purpose the leaves were taken promiscuously, without any
regard to their proper original order, and sewed together at
hap-hazard, sometimes top end down, and front side behind, just as
if they had been mere blanks, the sermons of Ephraem being the only
matter regarded in the book." Stowe, Hist. of the Books of the
Bible, p. 75. In the latter part of the seventeenth century, Allix
first observed the older writing under the works of Ephraem. It was
very illegible, but a chemical preparation applied in 1834-5
revivified it to a certain extent. It has been diligently collated
by eminent scholars, and in 1842 Tischendorf printed an edition of
it page for page and line for line. Of the two hundred and nine
leaves contained in this manuscript, one hundred and forty-five
belong to the New Testament, containing not quite two-thirds of the
sacred text. The order of the books is the same as in the
Alexandrine codex. <i>See No. (4), PLATE III</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the abovenamed four manuscripts, a few others may be
briefly noticed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An interesting palimpsest of great critical value is the
<i>Codex Dublinensis rescriptus</i>, <i>Dublin palimpsest
manuscript</i>, in the library of Trinity College, Dublin,
designated by the letter Z. It contains with other writings
thirty-two leaves of the gospel by Matthew. They were edited, as
far as legible, in 1801, by Dr. John Barrett, Fellow of Trinity
College. In 1853 Dr. Tregelles made a new and thorough examination
of the manuscript, and, by the aid of a chemical process, brought
all that exists of the gospel text to a legible condition. This
manuscript is assigned to the sixth century. Its letters are
written in a singularly bold style, which unites the three
qualities of ease, elegance, and symmetry.</p>
<p>A celebrated <i>bilingual</i> manuscript (in this case
<i>Graeco-Latin</i>, containing the Greek and Latin texts) is the
<i>Codex Bezae</i>, <i>Beza's manuscript</i>, called also <i>Codex
Cantabrigiensis</i>, <i>Cambridge manuscript</i>, from the place of
its deposit, which is the public library of the University of
Cambridge, England. It is designated by the letter D, and contains
the four gospels and Acts of the Apostles in Greek and Latin on
opposite pages, stichometrically written. The account of Theodore
Beza, its former possessor, was that he found it during the French
civil wars in 1562, in the monastery of St. Iren&aelig;us, at
Lyons. In 1581 he sent it as a present to the University
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id=
"page388"></a>{388}</span> of Cambridge. The interest felt in this
manuscript arises in great part from the very peculiar character of
its readings. "The text of this codex," says Bleek (Introduc. to
New Test., sec. 270), "presents much that is peculiar&mdash;many
additions and alterations that have even an apocryphal character,
but are yet not uninteresting. Its native country is the West, and
more definitely the south of Gaul." <i>See No. (5), PLATE
IV</i>.</p>
<p>Among the <i>fragments</i> of manuscripts of high antiquity is
one called <i>Codex purpureus</i>, <i>Purple manuscript</i>.
<i>Four</i> leaves of this are in the Cotton Library in the British
Museum, <i>six</i> in the Vatican, <i>two</i> in the Imperial
Library at Vienna. The manuscript to which they belonged was
written in silver letters (the names of God and Christ in gold) on
purple vellum. The writing is in two columns with large and round
letters. It is referred to the end of the sixth or beginning of the
seventh century.</p>
<p>Many other uncial manuscripts, or fragments of manuscripts, some
of them of great critical value, might be described; but the above
brief notices must suffice. Of those which contain ancient
<i>versions</i>, a few of the more important will be noticed in the
following chapter.</p>
<p>The <i>cursive</i> manuscripts of the Now Testament are numbered
by hundreds. In general their authority is less than that of the
more ancient uncials. But a cursive manuscript may give indirectly
a very ancient text. There are some cursives which, from their
characteristic readings, were manifestly executed from codices of
high antiquity, and are for this reason very valuable. As such
Tregelles specifies those numbered 1 and 33. For further notices of
these, as also of the <i>lectionaries</i>, containing selections
for church readings, the reader may consult the works devoted to
biblical criticism.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II. THE PRINTED TEXT.</h3>
<p>6. The <i>primary editions</i> of the Greek New Testament,
whence is derived what is called <i>the received text</i>
(<i>Textus receptus</i>) are the following: (1) the
<i>Complutensian</i>; (2) the <i>Erasmian</i>; (3) those of
<i>Robert Stephens</i>; (4) those of <i>Beza</i> and
<i>Elzevir</i>. Their authority in textual criticism depends wholly
upon that of the manuscripts from which their text was formed. As
no stream can rise higher than its fountains, so no printed text
can obtain a just weight of influence above that of its manuscript
sources. It becomes, then, a matter of interest to inquire what was
the basis of these early printed editions.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id=
"page389"></a>{389}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>(1.) The entire New Testament was printed for the first time in
Greek in the fifth volume of the <i>Complutensian Polyglott</i> (so
called from <i>Complutum</i>, that is <i>Alcala</i> in Spain, where
it was printed under the patronage of Cardinal Ximenes). It bears
the date of 1514, but was not published until 1522, when Erasmus
had already printed three editions of his Greek Testament. Its
editors professed to have formed their text from manuscripts sent
to them from the papal library at Rome. What these manuscripts were
cannot now be ascertained; but that they were very ancient and
correct, as alleged by these editors, is contradicted by the
character of the text, which agrees with the modern in opposition
to the most ancient manuscripts.</p>
<p>(2.) At the request of Froben, a celebrated printer and
publisher of Basle, <i>Erasmus</i>, who was then in England, where
he had devoted some time to a revised Latin translation of the New
Testament with annotations, went to Basle in 1515, and began the
work of editing a Greek New Testament. "By the beginning of March,
1516," says Tregelles, "the whole volume, including the annotations
as well as the Greek and Latin texts, was complete; in less, in
fact, than six months from the time that the first sheet was
begun." The design of this haste was to anticipate the publication
of the Complutensian edition. The critical apparatus in Erasmus'
possession was quite slender. It consisted of such manuscripts as
he found at Basle, with the help of the revised Latin translation
already prepared in England and Brabant. For the Apocalypse he had
but one manuscript, and that defective at the end. In his four
subsequent editions&mdash;1519, 1522, 1527, 1535&mdash;he made many
corrections. In that of 1527 he availed himself of the
Complutensian text. This edition, from which the fifth and last
published during his life differs but slightly, is the basis of the
common text now in use.</p>
<p>(3.) In 1546, 1549, 1550, appeared the three editions of
<i>Robert Stephens</i>, the celebrated Parisian printer. In the
first two of these the text is said to have been formed from the
Complutensian and Erasmian. In the third edition, although he had
the aid of thirteen Greek manuscripts, his text is almost identical
with that of Erasmus' fifth edition.</p>
<p>(4.) In 1565, <i>Theodore Beza</i> published at Geneva his first
edition of the Greek Testament with his own Latin version, and also
the Vulgate with annotations. Three other editions followed in
1576, 1582, 1588-9. He had the use of the Codex Bezae above
described, the Codex Claromontanus (an ancient Graeco-Latin
manuscript of the Pauline epistles), the Syriac version then
recently published by Tremellius, with a close Latin translation,
and Stephens' collations. But he is said not to have made much use
of these helps.</p>
<p>The first of the <i>Elzevir</i> editions, so celebrated for
their typographical beauty, was issued in 1624, its text being
mainly copied from that of Beza. This is the text that has acquired
the name of <i>Textus receptus</i>, the <i>Received Text</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id=
"page390"></a>{390}</span> as it was for more than a century the
basis of almost all subsequent editions. The genealogy of this
<i>Textus receptus</i> is thus succinctly given by Bishop Marsh:
"The <i>Textus receptus</i>, therefore, or the text in common use,
was copied, with a few exceptions, from the text of Beza. Beza
himself closely followed Stephens; and Stephens (namely, in his
third and chief edition) copied solely from the fifth edition of
Erasmus, except in the Revelation, where he followed sometimes
Erasmus, sometimes the Complutensian edition. The text, therefore,
in daily use, resolves itself at last into the Complutensian and
the Erasmian editions." Divinity Lectures, part I, p. 111.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. It requires but a moderate acquaintance with the history of
textual criticism to understand that the Elzevir text is not only
not perfect, but is more imperfect than that which has been
elaborated by the help of the abundant manuscripts, versions, and
citations of the early fathers, of which modern criticism has
availed itself. It is no reproach to the editors of the primary
editions that, with their comparatively scanty materials, they
could not accomplish as much as we can with the rich and varied
means at our disposal. The <i>essential integrity</i> of the
received text, we do indeed thankfully acknowledge and firmly
maintain. Our fathers had presented to them in this text the same
divine and glorious Saviour, the same way of salvation, the same
holy system of doctrines and duties, as we now find in the most
carefully revised modern text. Nevertheless, a true reverence for
the inspired word must impel us to the diligent use of all the
means at our command for setting forth a pure text, that is, a text
conformed as nearly as possible to that of the original autographs.
Viewed in this light the modern critical editions of the New
Testament must possess a deep interest for all who are able to read
it in the original tongue. But to discuss the merits of these would
be foreign to the design of the present work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples of the more important various readings occur in John
1:18; Acts 20:28; 1 Tim. 3:16. The passage 1 John 5:7, 8, <i>in
heaven&mdash;in earth</i>, is generally rejected on the testimony
of the manuscripts (see the full discussion in Horne, vol. 4, ch.
36). Among the passages which are regarded as more or less doubtful
may be mentioned John 5:4; 8:3-11; <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page391" id="page391"></a>{391}</span> Acts 8:37. In regard to all
these the biblical scholar must be referred to the critical
commentaries. So also for the questions connected with the text of
Mark 16:9-20, which are of a peculiar character.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>III. PRINCIPLES OF TEXTUAL CRITICISM.</h3>
<p>8. The end proposed by textual criticism is to restore the
sacred text as nearly as possible to its primitive purity (Chap. 7,
No. 1). To this work the biblical scholar should come in a candid
and reverential spirit, prepared to weigh carefully all the
evidence which is accessible to him, and decide, not as an
advocate, but as a judge, in the simple interest of truth. The
three great sources of evidence for the original text of the New
Testament are Greek manuscripts, versions, and the citations of the
fathers. Of these, <i>Greek manuscripts</i> hold the first place.
But all manuscripts are not of equal value. Other things being
equal, the oldest manuscripts have the highest authority. "If the
multiplication of copies of the New Testament had been uniform, it
is evident that the number of later copies preserved from the
accidents of time would have far exceeded that of the earlier, yet
no one would have preferred the fuller testimony of the thirteenth
to the scantier documents of the fourth century. Some changes are
necessarily introduced in the most careful copying, and these are
rapidly multiplied." Westcott in Smith's Bible Dict.; Art. New
Test. Yet, as the same writer remarks, we may have evidence that a
recent manuscript has been copied from one of great antiquity, and
thus has preserved to us very ancient readings. Revisions and
corrections by a later hand are to be carefully distinguished from
the primitive writing. Yet these may be valuable, as testifying to
the prevailing reading of the age to which they belong. The general
class or family to which a given manuscript belongs is also to be
taken into the account. In a word, so many elements of judgment are
to be taken into account in determining the relative weight of
authority that belongs to a given manuscript, that the right
decision of the question requires large observation combined with
much critical tact.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id=
"page392"></a>{392}</span>
<p>9. <i>Ancient versions</i> are of great value in textual
criticism; for some of them, as the old Latin and Syriac, to which
may be added the old Egyptian versions, are based on a text more
ancient than that preserved to us in any manuscript. In textual
criticism, the testimony of a version is valuable in proportion to
its antiquity, its fidelity&mdash;not its elegance or even its
correctness of interpretation, but its literal closeness&mdash;and
the purity of its text. Versions are liable to all the corruptions
of text incident to Greek manuscripts, and far more liable to
interpolations by explanatory glosses. The difference of idiom,
moreover, frequently prevents such a literal rendering as shall be
a sure indication of the form belonging to the original text.</p>
<p>10. The <i>citations</i> of the church fathers, which are
immensely numerous, constitute another source of testimony. But
less authority belongs in general to these, because they are often
made loosely from memory alone. Their testimony is chiefly valuable
as <i>corroborative</i>. "Patristic citations <i>alone</i> have
very little weight; such citations, even when in accordance with a
version, have but little more; but when a citation <i>is</i> in
accordance with some ancient MSS. and translations, it possesses
great corroborative value. It is as <i>confirming</i> a reading
known independently to exist, that citations are of the utmost
importance. If alone, or nearly alone, they may be looked at as
mere casual adaptations of the words of the New Testament."
Tregelles in Horne, vol. 4, ch. 34.</p>
<p>11. The <i>application</i> of the above sources of criticism to
the sacred text demands very extensive research and much sound
judgment. "Canons of criticism," as they are called are valuable in
their proper sphere; but, as Westcott remarks (<i>ubi supra</i>),
"they are intended only to guide and not to dispense with the
exercise of tact and scholarship. The student will judge for
himself how far they are applicable in every particular case; and
no exhibition of general principles can supersede the necessity of
a careful examination of the characteristics of separate witnesses,
and of groups of witnesses."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id=
"page393"></a>{393}</span>
<p>We bring this subject to a close by an enumeration of the last
six of the thirteen rules laid down by Westcott.</p>
<p>8. "The agreement of ancient MSS., or of MSS. containing an
ancient text, with all the ancient versions and citations marks a
certain reading."</p>
<p>9. "The disagreement of the most ancient authorities often marks
the existence of a corruption anterior to them."</p>
<p>10. "The argument from internal evidence is always precarious."
This canon he illustrates by several examples: "If a reading is in
accordance with the general style of the writer, it may be said on
the one side that this fact is in its favor, and on the other that
an acute copyist probably changed the exceptional expression for
the more usual one," &amp;c.</p>
<p>11. "The more difficult reading is preferable to the simpler."
This canon rests on the obvious ground that a copyist would be more
apt to substitute an easy reading for a difficult than the
reverse.</p>
<p>12. "The shorter reading is generally preferable to the longer."
Because of all corruptions of the text, additions from parallel
passages, or to meet its supposed wants, are the most common.</p>
<p>13. "That reading is preferable which explains the origin of the
others."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>FORMATION AND HISTORY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CANON.</h3>
<p>1. Respecting the canon of the New Testament there are two
distinct but related fields of inquiry. The first has reference to
the <i>origin and gradual accumulation, of the materials</i> which
enter into the canon; the second, to the <i>collection of these
materials</i> into a volume or series of volumes possessing
co&ouml;rdinate authority with the books of the Old Testament, and
constituting with them the sum of written revelation. The first of
these questions has been already discussed in great measure. In
Chs. 2-4, the genuineness, uncorrupt preservation, authenticity,
and credibility of the four gospels were shown at some length; in
Ch. 5 the same was done in respect to the Acts of the Apostles and
the acknowledged epistles; in Ch. 6 was considered the position of
the disputed books in respect to the canon; and in Ch. 7 the
inspiration of the canon was demonstrated. Connected with these
inquiries were some general notices respecting the date of the
several books of the New Testament; but the fuller consideration of
this latter question is reserved for the second division of the
present Part&mdash;that of Particular Introduction. It will be
sufficient to state here in a general way that, if we leave out of
account the writings of the Apostle John, the remaining books of
the New Testament were written somewhere between A.D. 45-70
(according to the commonly received opinion, between A.D. 50-70);
while the most probable date of John's writings is A.D. 70-100. The
composition of the books of the New Testament, then, spreads itself
over a period of about half a century.</p>
<p>2. Turning our attention, now, to the second question, that of
the collection and arrangement of these writings in a volume or
series of volumes co&ouml;rdinate in authority with the books of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id=
"page395"></a>{395}</span> the Old Testament, we have a succession
of periods, not sharply separated from each other, but each of them
possessing, nevertheless, its prominent characteristics in relation
to the canonical writings.</p>
<p>3. First in order is the <i>apostolic age</i>, extending to
about A.D. 100, especially the first half of it when many of the
apostles still survived. This is the period of the
<i>composition</i> of the books of the New Testament, but we have
no certain evidence that they were then collected into a whole. The
writings of apostles and apostolic men had of course the same
authority as their spoken word: that is, an authority that was
supreme and decisive, according to the principle laid down by the
Saviour: "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that
receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me." Matt. 10:40. But so long
as the churches had the presence of the apostles they could not
feel, as we do now, the need of an authoritative written rule of
faith and practice; nor is there any proof that the apostles
themselves understood in the beginning of the gospel God's purpose
to add, through them, a second part to the canon of revelation that
had been for so many centuries closed. A considerable number of
years elapsed after the ascension before it was thought necessary
to give to the churches under apostolic sanction a written account
of our Lord's life and teachings. The Acts of the Apostles were not
composed till about A.D. 61-63. The apostolic epistles were for the
most part written on special occasions and to meet special
exigencies, the greater number of them not till between A.D. 50-70,
those of John still later. The Christians of this age drew their
knowledge of the gospel mainly from the same sources to which Luke
refers in the preface to his gospel; from oral tradition, namely,
received directly or indirectly from them "who from the beginning
were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word."</p>
<p>4. After the death of the apostles came what may be called the
<i>age of the apostolic fathers</i>; men who, like Ignatius,
Polycarp, and others whose names have not come down to us, had been
the disciples of the apostles. Ignatius suffered martyrdom at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id=
"page396"></a>{396}</span> Rome, A.D. 107 or 116. Polycarp survived
beyond the middle of the second century. The literary remains of
this period are very scanty, the genuine writings of the apostolic
fathers being confined to a few epistles&mdash;one of Clement of
Rome to the Corinthians, seven of Ignatius, one of Polycarp to the
Philippians, to which we may add the so-called epistle of Barnabas;
since whoever was the author, it does not date from later than the
early part of the second century. From these writings we gather in
general that the gospels and apostolic epistles were in current use
in the churches, but nothing definite in regard to the collection
of these writings into a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With the exception of the epistles of <i>Jude</i>, <i>2
Peter</i> and <i>2, 3 John</i>, with which no coincidences occur,
and 1, 2 Thessalonians, Colossians, Titus, and Philemon, with which
the coincidences are very questionable, all the other epistles were
clearly known, and used by them; but still they are not quoted with
the formulas which preface citations from the Old Testament (The
Scripture saith, It is written, &amp;c.), nor is the famous phrase
of Ignatius (To the Philadelphians 5: Betaking myself to the
gospel, as to the flesh of Christ, and to the apostles, as the
eldership of the church) sufficient to prove the existence of a
collection of apostolic records as distinct from the sum of
apostolic teaching. The coincidences with the gospels on the other
hand are numerous and interesting, but such as cannot be referred
to the exclusive use of our present written gospels." Westcott, in
Smith's Bible Dict.; Art. Canon. The reason of this, as the writer
goes on to show, was that "the details of the life of Christ were
still too fresh to be sought for only in written records." There
is, however, one remarkable passage in the epistle of Barnabas, the
<i>Greek text</i> of which has been recently discovered appended to
the Sinaitic manuscript, in which he says (ch. 4): "Let us take
care that we be not found as it is written, many are called, but
few are chosen." This formula, "as it is written," distinguishes
the gospel from which it is quoted as a part of the inspired word;
for it is the customary formula employed by Christ and his apostles
in accordance with the usage of their age, when they appeal to the
Old Testament as of divine authority; and is never applied to
writings of mere human authority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Next in order comes what may be called the <i>period of
transition</i> between the age of the apostolic and that of the
early church fathers. The most distinguished writer of this period
is Justin Martyr. It is now generally conceded that the "Memoirs"
of which he so often speaks were our canonical gospels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id=
"page397"></a>{397}</span> Chap. 2, No. 7. Besides the abundant use
of these he mentions the Apocalypse by name, and ascribes it
expressly to the apostle John&mdash;"a certain man among us named
John, one of the apostles of Christ, prophesied, in the revelation
given him, that those who have believed in our Christ will spend a
thousand years in Jerusalem," etc. Dialogue with Trypho, chap. 81.
He has also some apparent allusions to the Pauline epistles, but
how far he possessed and used a collection of the New Testament
writings, we have no means of judging. Towards the middle of the
second century, however, events occurred which had a powerful
influence, not indeed, for establishing the <i>authority</i> of the
apostolic writings (since that existed from the beginning), but for
bringing home to the consciousness of the churches their <i>supreme
importance</i> as an authoritative rule of faith and practice, and
also the necessity of carefully defining their extent as well as
their true interpretation. Heretical teachers arose who sowed in
the Christian church the seeds of gnosticism. Of these some, as
Marcion, rejected on dogmatical grounds a portion of the apostolic
writings, and mutilated those which they retained; others, as
Valentinus, sought by fanciful principles of interpretation to
explain away their true meaning. Chap. 2, No. 12. The reaction upon
the churches was immediate and effectual. They set themselves at
once to define and defend the true apostolic writings as well
against Marcion's false and mutilated canon, if canon it may be
called, as against the false interpretations of Valentinus,
Heracleon and others. The <i>occasion</i> had now come for the
recognition of a New Testament canon co&ouml;rdinate in authority
with that of the Old Testament, and from this time onward we find
the idea of such a canon clearly developed in the writings of the
church fathers. What aided essentially in this work was the
execution, about this time, of <i>versions</i> of the New Testament
books, such as the Old Latin and Syriac; for the authors of these
versions must of necessity have brought together the writings,
which, in their judgment, proceeded from the apostles and their
companions.</p>
<p>6. We find, accordingly, when the <i>age of the early church
fathers</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id=
"page398"></a>{398}</span> opens, about A.D. 170, a clearly
recognized canon&mdash;sometimes described in two parts, the
<i>gospels</i> and the <i>apostles</i>&mdash;which is placed on a
level with that of the Old Testament as the inspired word of God,
and cited in common with it as <i>the Scriptures</i>, <i>the divine
Scriptures</i>, <i>the Scriptures of the Lord</i>, etc. Both canons
are mentioned together as <i>The entire Scriptures both prophetical
and evangelical</i>; <i>The prophets, the gospel, and the blessed
apostles</i>; <i>the law and the prophets, with the evangelical and
apostolical writings</i>; <i>the Old and the New Testament</i>;
<i>the entire instrument of each Testament</i>, etc.
<i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, against heresies, 2. 46; 5. 20; <i>Letter to
Florinus</i> in Eusebius' Hist. Eccl., 5. 20: <i>Clement of
Alexandria</i>, Strom., 7, p. 757; <i>Tertullian</i>, against
heretics, chap. 30. 36: against Marcion, 4. 6, etc. The canon was
not, however, completed in its present form; for the right of
certain books&mdash;the so-called <i>antilegomena</i>, chap. 6.
6.&mdash;to a place in it remained for a considerable time an open
question, which, in its application to particular books was
answered differently in the East and the West. See chap. 6. On the
other hand, certain writings of the apostolic fathers (as the
so-called epistle of Barnabas, the Shepherd of Hermas, the epistle
of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians), being read in certain of
the early churches, found their way into some codices of the New
Testament. Chap. 6, No. 4.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the latter part of the second century belong two important
canons, that of the Syriac Peshito, and the Muratorian canon. The
former of these represents the judgment of the <i>Eastern</i>
churches; the latter apparently that of the <i>Western</i>.</p>
<p>The canon of the Peshito has, of the seven disputed books,
<i>Hebrews</i> and <i>James</i>. It wants the other five, namely,
<i>2 Peter</i>, <i>2, 3 John</i>, <i>Jude</i>,
<i>Revelation</i>.</p>
<p>The Muratorian canon is in such an imperfect state that its
testimony on some points is doubtful. It contains <i>Jude</i> and
<i>Revelation</i>; perhaps also <i>2, 3 John</i>. It wants
<i>Hebrews</i>, and <i>2 Peter</i>, and it adds the apocryphal book
called the <i>Apocalypse of Peter</i>.</p>
<p>Origen in the third century (as quoted by Eusebius, Hist. Eccl.,
6. 25) and Eusebius in the fourth, Hist. Eccl., 3. 25, give each a
review of the New Testament canon with a statement of the differing
judgments as to the disputed books. The details will come up
hereafter in connection with the books in question.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id=
"page399"></a>{399}</span>
<p>The Synodical Council of Loadicea, which was probably held
between A.D. 343-381, gives in its 60th canon (the genuineness of
which, however, has been called in question by some) a list of the
books of the Old and New Testaments. That of the New Testament
wants the <i>Apocalypse</i>.</p>
<p>The third Council of Carthage, held A.D. 397, contains all the
books of our present canon. So also the Latin fathers, as Jerome,
Rufinus, etc. But the Syrian churches still adhered to the canon of
the Peshito.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. The history of Christian opinion in regard to the canon of
the New Testament, of which a very brief outline has been given,
has all the marks of naturalness and truthfulness. The Biblical
student should carefully remember the two following important
considerations:</p>
<p>(1.) The books of the New Testament were not received as a
whole, but <i>separately</i> upon the evidence that each gave of
its apostolic origin. Doubts in respect to certain books throw no
shadow of suspicion upon the rest, the genuineness and authenticity
of which were acknowledged by all from the beginning. The question,
therefore, is not concerning the truth of revelation, but simply
concerning the claims of certain books to be a part of the record
of revelation. However it may be decided in particular cases, the
apostolic authority of the universally acknowledged books, which
constitute the main body of the New Testament, remains perfectly
sure.</p>
<p>(2.) The early diversities of judgment in respect to certain
books furnish satisfactory evidence of the freedom of thought and
discussion among the primitive Christians, and of the sincerity and
earnestness of their investigations. It was precisely because they
would not accept any book without full evidence of its apostolic
authority, that these diversities of judgment prevailed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>ANCIENT VERSIONS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>
<p>In the present chapter those versions of the Old Testament also
that were made in connection with versions of the New, and in the
interest of Christianity, will be briefly considered.</p>
<h3>I. LATIN VERSIONS.</h3>
<p>1. A peculiar interest attaches to the early Latin versions. The
"<i>Old Latin</i>" translation of the New Testament, in connection
with which one of the Old Testament was executed from the
Septuagint, is perhaps the earliest that exists in any language.
The Old Syriac alone can rival it in antiquity, and if either may
claim the precedence, it is probably the Latin. This version, and
afterwards the revision of it by Jerome, was the grand medium
through which the Holy Scriptures were known to the Western or
Latin churches for more than twelve centuries. It has exercised no
small influence on the popular modern versions of Christendom, and
it is the great storehouse of theological terms for both Catholic
and Protestant Christianity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The English version of Wiclif (1324-1384) is a literal
translation of the current text of the Latin Vulgate. The Psalter
of the English Prayer Book is taken from Cranmer's Bible called the
"Great English Bible:" and the version of the Psalms follows the
Gallican Psalter, the second of the revisions made by Jerome from
the Old Latin. See below, No. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. How early the <i>ante-Hieronymian</i> Latin version (that
current before the days of <i>Hieronymus</i>, that is,
<i>Jerome</i>), was executed is unknown; but the writings of
Tertullian furnish satisfactory proof that it was in popular use in
North Africa (the place where it was made) in the last quarter of
the second century. According to the testimony of the ancient
church <span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id=
"page401"></a>{401}</span> fathers, its text existed in a great
variety of forms, and the same variety has come down to us in the
old manuscripts that contain it. Some, indeed, have maintained that
several independent versions existed. But the sum of the evidence
from both the early fathers and the manuscripts goes to show that
there was never more than one that could be called independent. The
copies of this were subjected to multiplied emendations or
revisions from the Greek original, till the text had fallen in the
days of Augustine and Jerome into a state of great confusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language of Augustine is very strong: "The translators of
the Scriptures from the Hebrew tongue into the Greek can be
numbered, but the Latin interpreters can by no means be numbered.
For whenever, in the first ages of Christianity, any one had gained
possession of a Greek manuscript, and imagined himself to possess
some little skill in the two languages, he ventured to become an
interpreter." De Doct. Christ. 2. 16. According to the received
opinion the so-called <i>Itala</i> (<i>Italian</i>) was not an
independent version, but one of these revisions, apparently made in
Italy, and as some think, under ecclesiastical auspices. This,
Augustine recommends as more faithful and perspicuous than the
rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. The <i>canon</i> of the Old Latin version seems to have
wanted, in the New Testament, Hebrews, James, and 2 Peter. In the
Old Testament it followed the Septuagint. It contained, therefore,
the apocryphal books of that version, to which was also added the
second of Esdras. Appendix to Pt. 2, No. 6. The <i>text</i> of this
version is known to us from two sources, quotations and
manuscripts. For our knowledge of the Old Testament we are
dependent mainly on the quotations of the early Latin fathers,
since only a few fragments remain in the shape of manuscripts. The
same is true of some parts of the New Testament, particularly the
Apocalypse. But of the gospels as well as other parts of the New
Testament, we have some very ancient manuscripts which are of high
value in textual criticism. The agreement of this version in many
characteristic readings with the oldest known Greek manuscripts has
already been noticed. Chap. 3, No. 3. Such agreement is the
strongest possible testimony <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page402" id="page402"></a>{402}</span> for the genuineness of the
readings in question. Chap. 26, No. 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>Codex Vercellensis</i>, belonging to the fourth century,
and said to have been written by Eusebius, bishop of Vercellae (now
Vercelli) in Northern Italy where the manuscript is preserved, is
one of the oldest manuscripts of the sacred text in existence. The
<i>Codex Veronensis</i> at Verona, the Graeco-Latin <i>Codex
Claromontanus</i> in the Imperial Library at Paris, the <i>Codex
Vindobonensis</i> at Vienna, the <i>Codex Bobbiensis</i> at Turin,
and others that might be named, are also very ancient. Among the
codices that contain what is called the <i>Italic</i> version, is
the <i>Brixianus</i> of the sixth century.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. About A.D. 388, Jerome at the solicitation of Damasus, bishop
of Rome, undertook the arduous task of <i>revising</i> the Old
Latin version by a comparison with the original Greek text. In this
work he proceeded very cautiously, being well aware of the
prejudices which he must encounter on the part of multitudes who
could not discriminate between the authority of the original Greek
text and that of the Latin version made from it. He began with the
four gospels. According to his own testimony, he selected ancient
Greek manuscripts, but such as did not differ much from the Latin
usage; and in the use of these he so restrained his pen that, when
he had corrected those things only which seemed to change the
sense, he suffered the rest to remain as they were. (Preface to the
four gospels addressed to Damasus.) His work of revision was
afterwards extended to the remaining books of the New Testament; a
revision which Tregelles describes as "less complete and uniform
than that of the gospels, and in which many parts seem to have
received hardly any alterations from his hand." In Horne, vol. 4,
ch. 23. About the same time he turned his attention to the Latin
version of the Old Testament, which had been made, not from the
original Hebrew, but from the Greek Septuagint. Of this he first
revised the Psalter, but not very thoroughly; in his own words,
"cursorily for the most part." This first revision is known by the
name of the <i>Roman</i> Psalter. A later and more thorough
revision, executed by Jerome at Bethlehem between A.D. 384-391, is
called the <i>Gallican</i> Psalter. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page403" id="page403"></a>{403}</span> There is good reason to
believe that Jerome's revision extended to all the remaining books
of the Old Testament, though we have positive evidence in respect
to only a part of them&mdash;Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
Canticles, Chronicles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gregory of Tours is said to have introduced Jerome's second
revision of the Psalter into the public service in France; whence
its name <i>Gallican</i>. The Roman Psalter was retained in Italy
till the time of Pius V., who introduced the Gallican generally.
But three churches, one of them that of the Vatican, continued to
use the Roman Psalter. Westcott in Smith's Bible Dict.; Art.
Vulgate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Jerome was soon convinced of the necessity of undertaking a
<i>new translation</i> of the Old Testament from the original
Hebrew. To this arduous task he addressed himself with great
earnestness, availing himself of the help of Jewish scholars to
complete his knowledge of the Hebrew. The whole work occupied his
time, with periods of intermission, from A.D. 385 to A.D. 405. See
in Horne, vol. 2, p. 89. He did not venture, however, to make a new
version from the Hebrew of the book of Psalms, the constant use of
which in the church service was a barrier to the substitution of a
new translation. He accordingly retained his second <i>revision</i>
from the Septuagint, which is called the Gallican Psalter. Of the
Apocryphal books he translated only two, Judith and Tobit. The
remaining Apocryphal writings were retained in their old form. The
Latin bible thus in part revised and in part translated by Jerome
(most of the Apocryphal writings being left unrevised) is called
the <i>Vulgate</i>, that is <i>common</i> or <i>current</i>
version, although this term belonged, before the days of Jerome, to
the Old Latin itself. Its diversified character is thus briefly
indicated by Westcott.&mdash;"(1.) <i>Unrevised Old Latin</i>:
Wisdom, Eccl., 1, 2 Macc., Baruch. (2.) <i>Old Latin revised, from
the LXX.</i>: Psalter. (3.) <i>Jerome's free translation from the
original text</i>: Judith, Tobit. (4.) <i>Jerome's translation from
the original</i>: Old Testament except Psalter. (5.) <i>Old Latin
revised from Greek MSS.</i>: Gospels. (6.) <i>Old Latin cursorily
revised</i>: the remainder of New Testament." In Smith's Bible
Dict.; Art. Vulgate.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id=
"page404"></a>{404}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not necessary to follow the history of the text of the
Vulgate since Jerome's day. Suffice it to say that the simultaneous
use of the Old Latin and Vulgate led to a corruption of both texts,
which has not yet been thoroughly removed. The present standard
text is that called the <i>Clementine</i>, from Pope Clement VIII.,
under whose auspices the Vulgate was edited in 1592. This is better
than the preceding <i>Sixtine</i> edition, A.D. 1590, but not by
any means the pure text of Jerome, as it might be recovered,
proximately at least, by a careful collation of ancient manuscripts
and quotations.</p>
<p>The oldest and best manuscript of the Latin Vulgate Old and New
Testaments, is the <i>Codex Amiatinus</i> in the Laurentian Library
at Florence. It belongs to the sixth century, and exhibits the text
of Jerome in a very pure form, carrying us back to about 120 years
from Jerome's death. The <i>Codex Fuldensis</i> is said to belong
to the same century. There are other good manuscripts more or less
complete of the eighth and ninth centuries.</p>
<p>Many other Latin versions have appeared in modern times,
sometimes in connection with the original text, and sometimes
separately, which it is not necessary to notice in detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II. SYRIAC VERSIONS.</h3>
<p>6. The ancient Syriac version called the <i>Peshito</i> belongs,
in the judgment of biblical scholars, to the second century. It
comprises the Old Testament as well as the New. The version of the
Old Testament was made from the original Hebrew, and thus has the
honor of being the oldest translation of the Hebrew Scriptures for
Christian use, the Old Latin version having been made from the
Septuagint. The version of the New Testament was made in connection
with that of the Old, so that both together constitute one
work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Syrian tradition makes extravagant claims in respect to the
antiquity of the Peshito, telling us that it was executed by men
sent to Palestine by the apostle Thaddeus (whom tradition connects
with the founding of the church at Edessa), and by Abgarus, King of
Edessa, a contemporary of the Saviour. The Old Testament was
sometimes referred to a still earlier age&mdash;that of Solomon and
Hiram, or that of the captivity of the ten tribes. Without giving
credence to such traditions, we may well believe that it belongs to
the earliest period of the Syrian churches, and cannot be placed
later than the last part of the second century. Of the term
<i>Peshito</i>, that is, <i>simple</i>, there are different
explanations. The most usual is that it denotes a simple and
literal version, free from glosses and allegorical interpretations.
Tregelles suggests that it was called <i>simple</i> in contrast
with the translation made by Paul of Tela from the Hexaplar text of
Origen <span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id=
"page405"></a>{405}</span> (see below, No. 8), which was replete
with <i>asterisks</i> and <i>obeli</i> to mark Origen's revisions,
and had also marginal references. It is agreed that the Old
Testament was translated from the original Hebrew and Chaldee,
though the translators seem to have had before them the Greek
version of the Seventy, and to have consulted it in the progress of
their work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. The Peshito is a free, and at the same time, a faithful
version of Scripture, holding the first place among the ancient
versions for its general excellence, while it ranks with the Old
Latin in antiquity. Its authority in both textual criticism and
interpretation is deservedly high. As it regards textual criticism,
however, its value is diminished by the fact that its text has not
come down to us in a pure state. It has suffered in the same way as
the text of the Old Latin, though not to the same extent.</p>
<p>Among the manuscripts brought from the Nitrian monasteries, and
deposited in the British Museum, is one of great antiquity,
containing large portions of the four gospels in Syriac. Dr.
Cureton published in 1858 the text of this manuscript as "Remains
of a very ancient Syriac recension of the four gospels in Syriac,
hitherto unknown in Europe," with an English translation and
preface. Its appearance was hailed with lively interest and has
excited warm discussions. The manuscript itself is assigned to the
fifth century, but it presents a text which, in the judgment of
competent scholars, is older than the current text of the Peshito.
Whether it is an older form of the Peshito version, or another and
earlier version of the gospels, is a question that has been
differently answered. It is maintained, on the one hand, that the
Peshito is a revision of the Curetonian text, "replete with
readings unknown in the second century" (Tregelles in Smith's Bible
Dict.); on the other, that it is "an older version than the
Peshito; which the author or authors of the latter consulted
throughout." Davidson in Alexander's Kitto. Its great value for
critical purposes must be acknowledged by all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many characteristic readings it agrees with the oldest
manuscripts and quotations. It has also some erroneous readings
known to be of great antiquity. In a word, the high antiquity of
its text cannot be reasonably questioned. Drs. Cureton and
Tregelles think that the gospel of Matthew <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>{406}</span> may be a
translation from the apostle's Hebrew copy. But this is denied by
Davidson and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>8. The <i>Philoxenian</i> Syriac version was executed A.D. 508,
under the auspices of Philoxenus, or Xenaias, bishop of Hierapolis
or Mabug in Syria. Philoxenus belonged to the sect of the
Monophysites, and it is generally thought that the version was made
in the interest of that sect. The translator's name was Polycarp,
one of Philoxenus' rural bishops. With the exception, perhaps, of
certain books (see below), the text of this version has not come
down to us in its original form. We have only a <i>revision</i> of
it made A.D. 616 by Thomas of Harkel in a monastery of Alexandria,
whence this version is also called the <i>Harclean</i> Syriac. The
characteristic of this version is its extremely literal character.
It is the translator's aim to represent every Greek word, even the
article, by a corresponding Syriac word, even where the idiom of
the language must thereby be violated. Hence its style is of
necessity barbarous. But this very character of literalness gives
to the Philoxenian version high authority in respect to textual
criticism. So far as it has come down to us in its primitive form,
it is, in truth, equal to the Greek text of its own time.</p>
<p>About the time that Thomas of Harkel revised the Philoxenian
version of the New Testament, Paul of Tela, another Monophysite,
executed what is called the <i>Hexaplar Syriac</i> version of the
Old Testament, because it was made from the text of Origen's
Hexaplar. Chap. 16, No. 12. It coincides with the Philoxenian
version of the New Testament in respect to its character as well as
the time of its appearance, being made on the principle of
following the Greek text word for word as exactly as possible. Thus
the Hexaplar version of the Old, and the Philoxenian version of the
New, constitute together a whole of like character throughout.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the example of Origen, Paul introduced into his version
<i>asterisks</i> and <i>obeli</i>; the asterisk (*) to indicate
insertions made in the text on the authority of manuscripts and
other versions; the obelus (&divide;), to mark passages of doubtful
character. Thus it supplies, as far as a version can, the Hexaplar
of Origen, of which only a few fragments remain.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id=
"page407"></a>{407}</span>
<p>The Philoxenian version of the New Testament, as revised by
Thomas of Harkel, contains also the same asterisks and obeli.
Critical marks and marginal readings also appear in most of the
manuscripts. This critical apparatus is generally thought to have
proceeded from Thomas himself, in imitation of the Hexaplar Syriac
of the Old Testament; but whether to indicate comparison with the
Peshito, or with the Greek manuscripts employed by Thomas is not
certain.</p>
<p>There is a version of the Catholic epistles wanting in the
Peshito&mdash;2 Pet., 2, 3 John, Jude&mdash;existing in two forms,
one of which is thought to be the <i>unrevised</i> Philoxenian
text. There is a codex at Rome containing the four gospels which
has also been supposed to contain the same unrevised text.</p>
<p>The <i>Jerusalem Syriac Lectionary</i>, containing simply
lessons from the four gospels, is a peculiar version known to us
from a single manuscript in the Vatican Library which belongs to
the eleventh century. The version itself is referred by some to the
sixth century, by others to a later date. Its dialect is barbarous,
being a mixture of Chaldee and Syriac, but its readings are said
often to coincide with the oldest and best authorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>III. EGYPTIAN AND ETHIOPIC VERSIONS.</h3>
<p>9. Formerly but one version was known to exist in the language
of the ancient Egyptians. This, which was made in the dialect of
lower Egypt, was naturally called <i>Coptic</i>. When it was
discovered that another version existed in the dialect of upper
Egypt, the Arabic term <i>Sahidic</i> was applied to it. But since
the word <i>Coptic</i> is generic, applying to both dialects alike,
it has been proposed to call the former version
<i>Copto-Memphitic</i> or simply <i>Memphitic</i>, from Memphis,
the ancient capital of lower Egypt; and the latter
<i>Copto-Thebaic</i> or <i>Thebaic</i>, from Thebes, the celebrated
capital of ancient upper Egypt. When these versions were executed
cannot be determined with certainty. But they existed in the fourth
century, and probably in the latter part of the third century.
Their high antiquity gives to them great value in textual
criticism. The latter of them, however, exists only in a
fragmentary form. Some fragments of a <i>third</i> version,
differing from both the Memphitic and the Thebaic, have been
discovered. To this, the epithet <i>Bashmuric</i> has been applied,
from the Arabian name <i>Bashmur</i>, a district of lower Egypt in
the Delta to the East. But Egyptian scholars doubt whether the term
is well applied, as the version is said to have stronger affinity
to the Thebaic than to the Memphitic version.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id=
"page408"></a>{408}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>The Memphitic and Thebaic versions are said to have contained
the whole Bible, that of the Old Testament being made from the
Septuagint. The whole Memphitic New Testament has been several
times published, but never in such a manner as to meet the wants of
Biblical criticism. Of the Thebaic version only some fragments have
been published.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>10. An <i>Ethiopic</i> version of the whole Bible exists in the
ancient dialect of Axum. That of the Old Testament was made from
the Septuagint; that of the New is a close version of the original
Greek. The age to which it belongs is not known. Many of the
readings of its text are said to show an affinity with the older
class of Greek manuscripts, while others are of a later character.
This leads to the suspicion that the version has undergone revision
by the aid of later Greek manuscripts. An edition of the whole
Bible is in process of publication in Germany.</p>
<h3>IV. THE GOTHIC AND OTHER VERSIONS.</h3>
<p>11. The first information which European scholars had of the
existence of a <i>Gothic</i> version of the New Testament was in
the sixteenth century, when one Morillon copied from a Gothic
manuscript in the library of the Monastery of Werden in Westphalia
the Lord's Prayer and some other parts, which were afterwards
published. When the Swedes, in 1648, took Prague, among the spoils
sent to Stockholm was the celebrated <i>Codex Argenteus</i>,
<i>Silver manuscript</i>, containing a copy of the Gothic gospels
written on purple vellum in silver letters, except the beginnings
of the sections which are in gold. When entire the manuscript is
said to have contained 320 leaves, but when found it had but 188 in
quarto size. In its present state it wants parts of all the
gospels. The letters are deeply furrowed, and beautifully regular.
It is thought that this manuscript was executed for the use of some
Gothic king. After various changes of place, it was finally
deposited in the library of the University of Upsal in Sweden,
where it is now preserved enclosed in a silver case. The Gothic
version, of which the Codex Argenteus is a transcript, was made in
the fourth century by Ulphilas, second bishop of the Goths in
Moesia (the so-called Moeso-Goths). <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page409" id="page409"></a>{409}</span> The manuscript itself
belongs, it is thought, to the sixth century.</p>
<p>12. In 1762 a palimpsest was discovered by Knittel at
Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, a city of the duchy of Brunswick in Germany,
containing, as the earlier writing, part of the epistle to the
Romans in Gothic and Latin, the versions standing side by side. In
1817 the late Cardinal Mai discovered in the Ambrosian Library at
Milan five palimpsests, from which, in connection with the
Wolfenb&uuml;ttel palimpsest, the Gothic text of the greater part
of the Pauline epistles (that to the Hebrews not included) has been
recovered, as also some fragments of the gospels, and of the books
of Ezra and Nehemiah. All that has been recovered of the Gothic
version was edited in 1835-6 by Gabelentz and Loebe with a Latin
translation, notes, and a Gothic dictionary and grammar. There are
several later editions partly of the Codex Argenteus, and partly of
all the Gothic remains of the Scriptures. Thus this interesting
version, which represents the text of the New Testament in the
fourth century as it was known to Ulphilas, is made available for
the purposes of Biblical criticism.</p>
<p>13. There is an ancient <i>Armenian</i> version unaccompanied as
yet by any Latin translation; and thus available for critical
purposes only through the help of those who know the language. By
means of such help Dr. Tregelles used it for his critical edition
of the New Testament, and he speaks of its value "as a critical
witness as to the general reading of certain Greek copies existing
in the former half of the fifth century." In Smith's Bible Dict.,
Art. Armenian Version.</p>
<p>Other ancient versions, as the Arabic and Slavonic, we pass by;
as their comparatively late date makes them of little importance
for critical studies. The history of modern versions, among which
is our own authorized version, presents a wide and interesting
field of inquiry, but it does not come within the scope of the
present work.</p>

<hr />
<h2>SECOND DIVISION, PARTICULAR INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>THE HISTORICAL BOOKS.</h3>
<p>1. The New Testament, like the Old, is not an abstract system of
doctrines and duties, but a <i>record of facts</i> involving
doctrines and duties of the highest import. This record does not
constitute an independent history, complete in itself, and to be
explained in its own light. It is rather the necessary sequel to
the record of the Old Testament. It interprets the Old Testament,
and is itself interpreted by it. The two constitute together an
organic whole, and can be truly understood only in their mutual
connection. To discard the Old Testament whether formally or in
practice, is to throw away the key which unlocks to us the
treasures of the New; for the writers of the New Testament
continually reason out of the Scriptures of the Old. If we cannot
truly comprehend the Old Testament except when we view it as
preparatory to the revelation contained in the New, so neither can
we have a full understanding of the New except as the completion of
the revelation begun in the Old. In a word, we understand
revelation aright only in its unity.</p>
<p>2. The New Testament <i>uses</i> all the teachings of the Old,
but it does not <i>repeat</i> them all. The unity, personality, and
infinite perfections of God; his universal providence, and his
supremacy as well over nations as individuals; the duties that men
owe to God and each other, as embodied for substance in the ten
commandments and expanded in the teachings of Moses and the
prophets; the indissoluble connection, on the one hand, between
righteousness and true prosperity, and on the other, between sin
and ruin&mdash;all these great truths are so fully unfolded in the
Old Testament that they need no formal repetition in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id=
"page411"></a>{411}</span> New. The person and office of the
Messiah&mdash;as that great prophet, like unto Moses, whom God
should raise up for his people in the latter days; as that mighty
king of David's line, who should sit on his throne and in his
kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with
justice forever; as that high priest after the order of Melchisedec
whom God should establish forever with a solemn oath&mdash;had been
prefigured in the institutions of Moses, in the Psalms, and in the
writings of the prophets.</p>
<p>Some other important truths not so fully revealed in the Old
Testament but deducible in a legitimate way either from its general
scope or from some brief hints in its teachings, had become firmly
established in the faith of the Jewish people during the long
interval that elapsed between Malachi and Christ. Such particularly
were the doctrines of the resurrection of the dead and of future
rewards and punishments. These truths, also, as well as those more
directly and fully taught in the Old Testament, were assumed by the
Saviour and his apostles as a platform for the peculiar revelations
of the gospel, the sum of which is <i>Jesus Christ crucified for
the salvation of the world</i>. The four gospels, then, as
containing the history of our Lord's appearance and works, lie at
the foundation of the revelation contained in the New Testament. To
these, then, our attention must first be given; after which the
history of the apostolic labors, as given in the Acts of the
Apostles, will naturally follow.</p>
<h3>I. THE GOSPELS AS A WHOLE.</h3>
<p>3. The word <i>gospel</i> (Anglo-Saxon, <i>god</i>, <i>good</i>,
and <i>spell</i>, <i>history</i> or <i>tidings</i>) answers to the
Greek word <i>euangelion</i>, <i>good-tidings</i>, whence comes the
Latin <i>evangelium</i>, with the derived words in use among us, as
<i>evangelist</i>, <i>evangelical</i>, etc. It properly signifies
the <i>good message itself</i>, and it is only by a secondary usage
that it is applied to the <i>written histories</i> of the Saviour's
life, as being the embodiment of this message. The titles prefixed
to these gospels from the beginning; "The Gospel according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id=
"page412"></a>{412}</span> Matthew", "The Gospel according to
Mark," etc., indicate that the written record is not itself the
gospel, but rather an account of the gospel <i>according to</i>
these different writers. Christ himself is the author of the
gospel. It existed and was received by many thousands before a line
of it was put upon record on the written page.</p>
<p>4. The genuineness, uncorrupt preservation, and authenticity of
the four canonical gospels have already been shown at some length.
Chaps. 2, 3, 4. In connection with the argument for their
genuineness, their natural division into two parts&mdash;the first
three, commonly called the synoptical gospels, and the gospel
according to John; the remarkable agreements and differences of the
three synoptical gospels among themselves; and the remarkable
contrast which the fourth gospel presents to all three of the
synoptical gospels, have also been considered simply as <i>existing
facts</i>. Chap. 2, Nos. 14 and 15. But when we seek an
<i>explanation</i> of these remarkable phenomena, we enter upon a
very difficult problem, one on which the ingenuity of Biblical
scholars has exhausted itself for several successive generations
without reaching thus far a result that can be regarded as
perfectly satisfactory. Almost all conceivable theories and
combinations of theories have been proposed, some of which,
however, are now generally abandoned as untenable, and need not be
considered at large.</p>
<p>5. Looking at the three synoptical gospels, Matthew, Mark, and
Luke, we find a remarkable <i>agreement</i> not only in their
general plan, but in many of their details also. With the exception
of our Lord's last journey to Jerusalem and the history of his
passion there, they are mainly occupied with his ministry in
Galilee. The selection of incidents is also to a great extent the
same. "The most remarkable differences lie in the presence of a
long series of events connected with the Galilean ministry, which
are peculiar to St. Matthew and St. Mark (Matt. 14:22-16:12; Mark
6:45-8:26), and a second series of events connected with the
journey to Jerusalem (Luke 9:51-18:14), which is peculiar to St.
Luke." Westcott, Introduct. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page413"
id="page413"></a>{413}</span> to the Study of the Gospels, chap. 3.
The coincidences of language, as well as incident, are also
remarkable; and here the general law prevails that these
coincidences are more common, as has been shown by Norton and
others, in the recital of the words of others than in the narrative
parts of the gospels, and most common when our Lord's own words are
recited.</p>
<p>6. But with these remarkable agreements coexist equally
remarkable <i>differences</i>. Each writer has his own
peculiarities of style, which appear more distinctly in the
original than they can in any version. It has been noticed also by
Biblical scholars that these peculiarities are more marked in the
narrative than in the recitative parts of the gospels in question.
Each writer, moreover, brings in incidents peculiar to himself, not
in the form of patchwork, but as parts of a self consistent whole.
So far is he from exact outward conformity to either of the other
gospels, in respect to arrangement and circumstantial details, that
the diversity between him and them in these particulars, sometimes
creates serious difficulties when we attempt to arrange the three
different narratives in the form of a harmony.</p>
<p>7. No theory of the origin of these three gospels can be true
which does not explain both their coincidences and their
differences. Hence we may set aside at once the hypothesis of their
<i>mutual dependence</i> on each other&mdash;that the later
evangelists used the writings of the earlier. By the different
advocates of this theory, each of the three synoptic gospels has
been made in turn the primary record from which the others drew;
but no one of them has been able, upon this hypothesis, to account
for the omissions or insertions of the supposed later evangelists,
much less for the remarkable fact already noticed, that the
peculiarities of each writer appear more fully in the narrative
than in the recitative part of his gospel. The later evangelists
may, indeed, have been acquainted with the writings of the earlier
and have consulted them, but this supposition alone does not
explain their peculiar coincidences and differences.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis is that of an <i>original document or
documents</i>, from which all three are supposed to have drawn. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id=
"page414"></a>{414}</span> assumption of a single original written
gospel, as the basis of our first three canonical gospels, is
manifestly untenable. Had a primitive gospel existed of such
compass and authority as to be the common source of our three
synoptic gospels, it is inconceivable that the churches, which
carefully preserved these three gospels, though two of them
proceeded not from apostles themselves but only from their
companions, should have allowed the original gospel so speedily and
utterly to perish, that no traces of it remained in the days of
Iren&aelig;us, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria. Besides, this
hypothesis, as it was soon seen, does not explain the peculiar
relation of these gospels to each other in respect to coincidences
and differences. Hence various modifications were proposed&mdash;an
original Aramaic gospel with various Greek translations, this
original Aramaic gospel variously increased with new matter, etc.
In a word, the form of these assumed original documents was
hypothetically explained from the actual form of our three synoptic
gospels; the very reverse of the true problem, which was to
explain, from some reliable data, the form of the canonical gospels
themselves.</p>
<p>The remaining hypothesis is that of <i>oral tradition</i>
emanating from the apostles themselves, and maintained in its
purity during their lives by their personal presence and teaching.
That the gospel existed in this form alone for some years after the
beginning of Christianity is admitted by all. The apostles were
Christ's chosen witnesses of his life and teachings. From their
lips proceeded the tradition which now constitutes our written
gospels. The necessity of embodying this tradition in the form of
permanent records was not felt at the beginning. But, as the
churches were multiplied, oral tradition became liable to
corruption in many ways through the multiplicity of the organs
employed in its transmission. Then the need of written gospels
began to manifest itself, and it was natural that the apostles
should look to the supply of this need either by their own direct
agency, or by that of men writing with their knowledge and
approbation. How many years elapsed before the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>{415}</span>
appearance of the earliest of our canonical gospels, which is
commonly supposed to have been that of Matthew, we have no means of
ascertaining with accuracy. But we may reasonably suppose that the
period was long enough to allow the apostolic tradition of our
Lord's life and teachings to assume a somewhat definite shape in
respect to both matter and outward form. <i>First</i>, in respect
to <i>matter</i>. As their public instructions could not cover the
whole of our Saviour's history (John 20:30; 21: 25), they naturally
selected, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, those parts of it
which embodied the spirit and meaning of the whole. Since,
moreover, the apostles remained together at Jerusalem for some time
after our Lord's ascension (Acts 8:1; 15:6), it is highly
reasonable to suppose that in a matter of such moment they had a
mutual understanding&mdash;an understanding which, while it
interfered with the freedom of no one, secured a general agreement
as to the points in our Lord's history and teachings which should
be especially insisted on. <i>Secondly</i> in respect to <i>outward
form</i>. While the apostles were preserved by the illumination of
the Holy Spirit from any superstitious regard to the letter of our
Lord's teachings, their reverence for him as a perfect teacher,
whose words were truth unmixed with error, must have made them
anxious to put the oral tradition of his sayings into as perfect a
form as possible; whence the tradition of our Saviour's words would
assume from the first a more fixed form than that of his life
generally.</p>
<p>It is supposed by many that the writers of the first three
gospels drew each from this common body of oral tradition such
materials as suited his general plan; no one of them proposing to
give the whole of our Lord's history, or even to observe a strict
chronological order in the events recorded by him, any farther than
such order was rendered necessary by their nature and essential
connection. In the case of Matthew, who was one of the twelve
apostles, it might be thought that he wrote simply from his own
personal knowledge; but his gospel could not cover all the ground
of our Lord's history as known to him, and we may well suppose that
in the selection of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id=
"page416"></a>{416}</span> materials he had regard&mdash;not a
servile, but a free regard&mdash;to the common oral tradition of
the apostles, which was, in fact, the embodiment of their united
wisdom under the illumination of the Divine Spirit. Each
evangelist, as well Mark and Luke who were not apostles, as Matthew
who belonged to the number of the twelve, wrote independently of
the other two. The later writers may, indeed, have been acquainted
with the writings of the earlier, but a bare inspection of the
three gospels shows that there was no labored effort on the part of
one evangelist to adjust his work to those of the others. Hence
arise apparent discrepancies, as in the two genealogies of our
Lord, which it is sometimes hard to explain. But these very
difficulties witness to the independent truthfulness of the
writers. Had they written in concert, or borrowed systematically
from each other, such difficulties would not have existed.</p>
<p>Although apostolic oral tradition is thus made the main source
whence the writers of these gospels drew their materials, it is not
necessary to affirm or deny their use, in a subordinate way, of
written documents. That such documents existed in the time of Luke
we know from his own words, chap. 1:1. He does not condemn them,
but neither does he rely upon them. His gospel is not derived from
them, but from his own accurate investigations; "It seemed good to
me also, having accurately traced out all things from the
beginning" (as the original Greek means), "to write to thee in
order, most excellent Theophilus." Chap. 1:3. And if Luke, the
companion of Paul, was not dependent for his materials on any
previously existing writings, neither was Mark, the companion of
both Peter and Paul, nor Matthew, who was himself an apostle. Nor
can the incorporation of such writings into the synoptic gospels be
shown with any degree of probability. If it cannot be claimed for
this hypothesis of a primitive apostolic tradition, as the source
whence the writers of the synoptic gospels drew their materials,
that it explains all the phenomena of their mutual relation to each
other, it is, nevertheless, more satisfactory than any other that
has been proposed, and may be regarded as a near approximation to
the actual facts in the case.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id=
"page417"></a>{417}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>Between the <i>traditions</i> of which the apostle Paul speaks
(2 Thess. 2:15; 3:6; also, according to the original, 1 Cor. 11:2)
received immediately from his mouth or pen, and the pretended
traditions of later days, handed down from century to century
through a succession of uninspired men, the difference is that
between light and darkness, between truth and fiction. We have in
the <i>writings</i> of the New Testament the genuine apostolic
tradition, at first oral, but put into a written form during the
lifetime of the apostles. These traditions are the "gold, silver,
precious stones" of divine truth. All other traditions are the
"wood, hay, stubble" of human origin. In settling the question
respecting the <i>genuineness</i> of the New Testament writings, we
proceed as in the case of any other writings. We avail ourselves of
all the evidence within our reach, external and internal. We take
the testimony of Iren&aelig;us and Tertullian, and also of Marcion
and Valentinus; though none of them were inspired, and the two
latter were heretical. But when we have once determined what books
were written by apostles or apostolic men, these contain for us the
only authoritative <i>tradition</i>, as defined by the apostle:
"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
have been taught, whether by word or our epistle." 2 Thess.
2:15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>8. In comparing the synoptic gospels with each other and with
the fourth gospel, we must ever bear in mind that no one of them
professes to give a complete history of our Lord's life, or to
arrange all the incidents which he relates in the exact order of
time. Under the guidance of the divine Spirit each one pursues his
own course, independently of the others, here inserting what one or
more of the rest have omitted, or omitting what one or more of them
have inserted; and here, again, bringing in incidents without
regard to their exact chronological order, with some general
preface like the following: "at that time," Matt. 12:1; "and he
began again," Mark 4:1; "and it came to pass as he was alone
praying," Luke 9:18; "and it came to pass as they went in the way,"
Luke 9:57; etc. Thus the wisdom of God has given us, not all the
particulars of our Lord's history, but such a selection from both
the incidents of his public life and his public and private
teachings as best embodies the great facts of the gospel, and the
doctrines and duties connected with them. In the four canonical
gospels the church has, not all of our Lord's history and
teachings, but all that the Holy Ghost judged needful for her
establishment and edification to the end of time.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id=
"page418"></a>{418}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>Of our Lord's history before his baptism we have only his
genealogy in a twofold form; some notices of his miraculous
conception; an account of his birth and circumcision, with the
visions and prophecies connected with them; a history of his
preservation from Herod's attempt to destroy him; the subsequent
residence of his parents in Nazareth, with a single incident of his
childhood. Luke 2:40-52. All these particulars have, in one way or
another, a bearing on his divine mission and work as the Son of
God. The apocryphal gospels on the contrary, as, for example, the
Gospel of the Infancy, and the Gospel of Nicodemus, abound in
frivolous stories relating to our Lord's infancy and later life,
which have no connection with the great work of redemption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>9. The peculiarities of the fourth gospel, as well as its
relation to the three preceding gospels, will come up for
consideration hereafter. At present we only remark that John wrote
many years after the appearance of the synoptic gospels, and that,
whatever reference he may have had to them, his gospel constitutes,
in the plan of revelation, a <i>true complement</i> to the other
three. For (1) if we except the narrative of our Lord's passion, it
covers, for the most part, ground not occupied by them. They give
mainly the history of the Saviour's ministry in Galilee (Luke also,
at some length, that of his last journey to Jerusalem); the scene
of much of John's gospel, on the contrary, is Jerusalem and its
near vicinity. (2) John unfolds more fully the nature of our Lord's
person, and his peculiar relation to the Father and to his church.
This he does, more especially, in his prologue (chap. 1:1-18); in
the record of the Saviour's discussions with the Jews (chaps. 3,
5-12); and in that of his discourses addressed in private to the
circle of the apostles, chaps. 13-17. Thus John's gospel is
emphatically that of Christ's <i>person</i>, as illustrated by his
works and words; while the three earlier evangelists give rather
the gospel of his <i>public ministry</i>, through which his divine
person everywhere shines forth. This deeper view of our Lord's
person and office which the gospel of John unfolds met the wants of
the primitive church in a more advanced stage, when false teachers
were already beginning to sow the seeds of those errors which, in
the next generation, brought forth such a rank and poisonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id=
"page419"></a>{419}</span> harvest. The same great characteristics
adapt it to the wants of the church in all ages. Without the fourth
gospel she could not be completely furnished to meet the assaults
of error, which, from one generation to another, makes, with
unerring instinct, its main assault upon the person and office of
the Son of God.</p>
<p>But if the evangelical narrative would not be complete without
the fourth gospel, neither would it be perfect for the use of the
church with this alone. The record of our Lord's life and teachings
as given in the first three gospels is pre&euml;minently adapted to
popular instruction. It is precisely such a record as the preachers
of the gospel need in their public ministrations. With it they can
use the fourth gospel with effect; but without it they would want
the natural preparation for and introduction to those deep and
spiritual views of Christ's person and office which the
bosom-disciple unfolds. It is not in the three synoptic gospels,
nor in the gospel of John taken separately, that we find the
complete evangelical armor, but in the perfect whole of the
four.</p>
<p>10. Very numerous attempts have been made to construct
<i>harmonies</i> of the four gospels. One plan is to form out of
the whole, in what is supposed to be the true chronological order,
a continuous narrative embracing all the matter of the four, but
without repetitions of the same or similar words. Another plan is
to exhibit in chronological order, the entire text of the four
gospels arranged in parallel columns, so far as two or more of them
cover the same ground. The idea is very imposing, but the
realization of it is beset with formidable if not insurmountable
difficulties. It is certain that the evangelists do not always
follow the exact order of time, and it is sometimes impossible to
decide between the different arrangements of events in their
records. In the four narratives of the events connected with the
resurrection all harmonists find themselves baffled. Had we a full
account of all the particulars of that exciting scene, we might
undoubtedly assign to the different parts of each narrative its
true place in the order of time. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page420" id="page420"></a>{420}</span> But with our present means
of information this is impossible. Experience shows that the most
profitable way of studying the evangelical narrative is to take
<i>each gospel as a whole</i>, but with continual reference to the
parallel parts of the other gospels, so far as they can be
ascertained. In this work a good harmony, like that of Robinson,
may render essential service, though its arrangements must in many
cases be regarded only as <i>tentative</i>&mdash;essays at
obtaining the true order, rather than the certain determination of
it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relative number of <i>chapters</i> in the different gospels
does not give their true relation in respect to <i>size</i>. The
chapters are respectively 28, 16, 24, 21; which are to each other
in the proportion of 7, 4, 6, 5 1/4. But estimating according to
the number of pages (in an edition without breaks for the verses),
it will be found that the gospel of Luke holds the first place, its
size being to that of the other gospels nearly as 60 to 57, 35, 46.
The relation of Matthew's gospel to that of Mark, in respect to the
quantity of matter is then nearly that of 8 to 5.</p>
<p>In the notices of the separate gospels which follow it is not
thought necessary to give an elaborate analysis of their contents.
The aim will be rather to exhibit the prominent characteristics of
each, and its special office in the economy of divine
revelation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II. MATTHEW.</h3>
<p>11. The unanimous testimony of the ancient church is that the
first gospel was written by the <i>apostle Matthew</i>, who is also
called Levi. With his call to the apostleship he may have assumed
the name of Matthew, as Saul took that of Paul. He was of Hebrew
origin, the son of Alphaeus, and a tax-gatherer under the Roman
government, Matt. 10:3; Mark 2:14; 3:18; Luke 5:27, 29; 6:15; Acts
1:13. He was evidently a man of some means (Luke 5:29), and his
office must have required for its proper discharge a knowledge of
the Greek as well as of his native Hebrew; that is, Aramaean, as
the word Hebrew means in the New Testament, when applied to the
vernacular of the Palestine Jews.</p>
<p>12. The question respecting the <i>original language</i> of
Matthew's gospel has been, since the time of Erasmus, a matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id=
"page421"></a>{421}</span> controversy, in which eminent biblical
scholars have been found on different sides. The problem is to find
a solution which shall bring into harmony the following
well-established facts: (1) that, according to the united testimony
of the early church fathers, Matthew originally wrote his gospel in
Hebrew; (2) that our present Greek gospel has all the freedom of an
original work, that it has remarkable coincidences in language with
the second and third gospels, and especially that the citations
from the Old Testament which stand in our Lord's discourses follow
as a rule the Greek version of the Seventy; (3) that all the early
writers, those who testify to the Hebrew original of this gospel
included, receive and use our present Greek gospel as the genuine
and authoritative gospel of Matthew; (4) that the original Hebrew
gospel, to the existence of which there is such abundant testimony,
was allowed utterly to perish, while the Greek form of it alone was
preserved and placed at the head of the canonical books of the New
Testament.</p>
<p>13. The testimony from Papias, in the beginning of the second
century, and onward to the fourth century, has often been quoted
and discussed. It is not necessary to adduce it here at length. It
may be found in Kirchhofer, in the critical commentaries and
introductions, and also in the modern Bible dictionaries. The words
of Papias, as preserved to us by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., 3. 39) are
as follows: "Matthew therefore wrote the oracles in the Hebrew
dialect, and every one interpreted them as he was able." If there
were any ground for doubting what Papias meant by "the oracles," it
would be removed by the testimony of the later writers, as
Pantaenus and Origen (in Eusebius' Hist. Eccl., 5. 10; 6. 25),
Iren&aelig;us (Against Heresies, 3. 1), Eusebius himself (Hist.
Eccl., 3. 24), Epiphanius (Heresies, 29. 9; 30. 3), and others.
They who maintain that Matthew wrote originally in Greek suppose
that the early fathers confounded an apocryphal gospel, the
so-called "gospel according to the Hebrews," with the true gospel
of Matthew. Others think, perhaps with more reason, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>{422}</span> that the
gospel according to the Hebrews was a corrupted form, or, what
amounts to nearly the same thing, a close imitation of the true
Hebrew gospel of Matthew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ebionites and Nazarenes used each apparently a different
form of a Hebrew gospel which is sometimes called the gospel
according to Matthew, but more properly "the gospel according to
the Hebrews" (once by Jerome "the gospel according to the
apostles"). According to Epiphanius that in use among the Ebionites
was "not entire and full, but corrupted and abridged." Heresies,
30. 13. Jerome says: "Matthew, who is called Levi, having become
from a publican an apostle, first composed in Judea, for the sake
of those who had believed from among the circumcision, a gospel of
Christ in Hebrew letters and words. Who was the person that
afterwards translated it into Greek is not certainly known.
Moreover, the Hebrew copy itself is at this day preserved in the
library of C&aelig;sarea which Pampilus the Martyr collected with
much diligence. The Nazarenes, who live in Beroca, a city of Syria,
and use this volume, gave me the opportunity of writing it out." De
Vir. Illustr., 3. Here he certainly identifies this gospel, which,
as he repeatedly informs us, he translated, with the true Hebrew
gospel of Matthew. But he afterwards speaks of it more doubtfully,
as "the gospel according to the Hebrews," and more fully as "the
gospel according to the Hebrews, which is written indeed in the
Chaldee and Syriac language, but in Hebrew letters, which the
Nazarenes use to the present day, [being the gospel] according to
the apostles, or, as most think, according to Matthew" (Against the
Pelagians, 3); "the gospel which the Nazarenes and Ebionites use,
which we have lately translated from the Hebrew language into the
Greek, and which is called by most the authentic gospel of
Matthew." Comment. in Matt. 12:13. The most probable supposition is
that Jerome, knowing that Matthew originally wrote his gospel in
Hebrew, hastily assumed at first that the copy which he obtained
from the Nazarenes was this very gospel. The character of the
quotations which he and Epiphanius give from it forbids the
supposition that it was the true Hebrew gospel of Matthew. It may
have been a corrupted form of it, or an imitation of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>14. Of those who, in accordance with ancient testimony, believe
that the original language of Matthew's gospel was Hebrew, some
assume that the apostle himself afterwards gave a Greek version of
it. In itself considered this hypothesis is not improbable.
Matthew, writing primarily for his countrymen in Palestine, might
naturally employ the language which was to them vernacular. But
afterwards, when Christianity had <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page423" id="page423"></a>{423}</span> begun to spread through the
Roman empire, and it became evident that the Greek language was the
proper medium for believers at large; and when also, as is not
improbable, some of the existing canonical books of the New
Testament had appeared in that language, we might well suppose
that, in view of these circumstances, the apostle himself put his
gospel into the present Greek form. But it is certainly surprising
that, in this case, no one of the ancient fathers should have had
any knowledge of the matter. In view of their ignorance it seems to
be the part of modesty as well as prudence that we also should say
with Jerome: "Who was the person that afterwards translated it into
Greek is not known with certainty." The universal and unhesitating
reception of this gospel by the early Christians in its present
Greek form can be explained only upon the supposition that it came
to them with apostolic authority; that it received this form at the
hand, if not of Matthew himself, yet of an apostle or an apostolic
man, that is, a man standing to the apostles in the same relation
as Mark and Luke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This supposition will explain the freedom of Matthew's gospel
and its coincidences in language with the gospels of Mark and Luke.
An apostle or apostolic man would give a faithful, but not a
servile version of the original. The oral tradition of our Lord's
life and teachings from which the first three evangelists drew, as
from a common fountain (see above, No. 7), must have existed in
Palestine in a twofold form, Aramaean and Greek. The translator
would naturally avail himself of the Greek phraseology, so far as
the oral tradition coincided with that embodied in Matthew's
gospel. Those who have carefully examined the subject affirm that
the citations from the Old Testament adduced by Matthew himself in
proof of our Lord's Messiahship are original renderings, with more
or less literalness, from the Hebrew. The citations, on the
contrary, embodied in the discourses of our Lord himself follow, as
a rule, the Greek version of the Seventy; probably because the
translator took these citations as they stood in the oral tradition
of these discourses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the original Hebrew form of the gospel, being
superseded by the Greek in all the congregations of believers
except those that used exclusively the vernacular language of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id=
"page424"></a>{424}</span> Palestine, gradually fell into disuse.
The "gospel according to the Hebrews," noticed above, may have been
a corrupted form of this gospel or an imitation of it. As Marcion
chose the Greek gospel of Luke for the basis of his revision, so
the Ebionites and Nazarenes would naturally use the Hebrew gospel
of Matthew for their purposes.</p>
<p>15. The gospel of Matthew opens with the words: "The book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
In accordance with this announcement, it traces back our Lord's
lineage through David to Abraham, giving, after the manner of the
Jews, an artificial arrangement of the generations from Abraham to
Christ in three sets of fourteen each, chap. 1:17. To effect this,
certain kings of David's line are omitted&mdash;between Joram and
Ozias (the Uzziah of the Hebrews), Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah;
between Josias and Jechonias, Eliakim&mdash;and David is reckoned
twice; once as the last of a set of fourteen, then as the first of
the following fourteen. The thoroughly Jewish form of this
introduction indicates the primary design of Matthew's gospel,
which was to exhibit to his countrymen Jesus of Nazareth as their
<i>long promised Messiah and king</i>. To this he has constant
reference in the facts which he relates, and which he connects with
the prophecies of the Old Testament by such forms of quotation as
the following: "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
Lord by the prophet," chaps. 1:22; 2:15, 23; 13:35; 21:4; 27:35;
"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
prophet," chaps. 4:11; 8:17; 12:17; "then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by Jeremy the prophet," chap. 2:17; etc. His direct
references to the Old Testament in proof of our Lord's Messiahship
are more numerous than those of either of the other evangelists.
Peculiar to him is the expression "the kingdom of heaven," to
signify, in accordance with Rabbinic usage, the kingdom which the
Messiah was to establish in accordance with the prophecies of the
Old Testament; though he takes a spiritual view of its character,
and not the earthly and political view of the Jewish <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>{425}</span> doctors.
Another designation of the same idea, common to him with the other
evangelists, is "the kingdom of God," which also was current among
the Rabbins. This "kingdom of heaven" and "kingdom of God" is also
the kingdom of the Messiah. Chaps. 13:41; 20:21.</p>
<p>16. But precisely because Jesus of Nazareth is the promised
Messiah, his mission is not to the Jews only, but <i>to all
mankind</i>, in accordance with the original promise to Abraham:
"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." Gen.
22:18. While he records the fact that our Lord's personal ministry
was restricted to the Jews (chaps. 10:5, 6; 15:24), he also shows
from our Lord's own words that the unbelieving "children of the
kingdom"&mdash;the Jews as the natural heirs to the Messiah's
kingdom&mdash;shall be cast out, and the believing Gentiles
received into it (chaps. 8:11, 12; 21:43); and he brings his gospel
to a close with the great commission: "Go ye, therefore, and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world." Chap. 28:19, 20.</p>
<p>17. A striking characteristic of this gospel is the <i>fulness
and orderly manner</i> with which it records <i>our Lord's
discourses</i>. Striking examples of this are the Sermon on the
Mount (chaps. 5-7), his awful denunciation of the Scribes and
Pharisees (chap. 23), and the majestic series of parables (chap.
25). Doubtless, Matthew had by nature a peculiar endowment for this
work, which the Holy Spirit used to preserve for the church much of
our Lord's teachings which would otherwise have been lost. The
narrative part of this gospel, on the other hand, has not the
circumstantial fulness of the following gospel. As already
remarked, the field covered by Matthew's narrative is mainly that
of our Lord's Galilean ministry, with the great events connected
with his final visit to Jerusalem, though he gives indications of
repeated visits to that city. Chap. 23:37-39.</p>
<p>18. It has been assumed by some that Matthew follows, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id=
"page426"></a>{426}</span> general rule, the order of time. But
others deny this, thinking that his arrangement is according to
subject-matter rather than chronological sequence, especially in
the first part (Alexander's Kitto); and this appears to be the
correct judgment. He follows the exact order of time only when the
nature of the events recorded requires him to do so.</p>
<p>19. It is universally admitted that Matthew wrote his gospel
<i>in Palestine</i>. This fact accounts for the absence of
explanatory clauses relating to Jewish usages, such as are not
unfrequent in the gospel of Mark. As to the interpretation of
Hebrew words, as "Immanuel" (chap. 1:23); and the words on the
cross (chap. 27:46), that belongs to the Greek form of the gospel.
The <i>date</i> of this gospel is doubtful. According to the
tradition of the ancient church it was written first of the four
gospels. Assuming that it originally appeared in Hebrew, we may
reasonably suppose that a period of some years elapsed before it
was put into its present Greek form.</p>
<p>20. The <i>integrity</i> of this gospel is unquestionable. In
modern times the genuineness of the first two chapters has been
called in question by various writers, but the insufficiency of
their arguments has been shown by many, among whom may be mentioned
Davidson, Introduction to New Testament, vol. 1, pp. 111-127. In
the words of this writer the chapters in question are found "in all
<i>unmutilated</i> Greek MSS., and in all ancient versions;" "the
earliest fathers had them in their copies, and received them as a
part of the gospel;" "the ancient heretics and opponents of
Christianity were acquainted with this portion of the first
gospel;" "the commencement of the first chapter is closely
connected with something preceding;" and "the diction of these two
chapters bears the same impress and character which belong to the
remainder of the gospel, proving that the gospel, as we now have
it, proceeded from <i>one</i> author."</p>
<h3>III. MARK.</h3>
<p>21. There is no valid ground for doubting the correctness of the
ancient tradition which identifies the author of the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id=
"page427"></a>{427}</span> gospel with "John whose surname was
Mark" (Acts 12:12, 25; 15:37), who is called simply John (Acts
13:5, 13), and Marcus or Mark (Acts 15:39; Col. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11;
perhaps also 1 Peter 5:13). He was <i>cousin</i> to Barnabas (Col.
4:10, not <i>sister's son</i>, as in our version), which
relationship may explain Barnabas' earnest defence of him (Acts
15:37-39). His mother Mary resided in Jerusalem, and it was to her
house that Peter resorted immediately upon his miraculous
deliverance from prison (Acts 12:12). The intimacy of Peter with
Mary's family must have brought about an early acquaintance between
the apostle and Mark. Ancient tradition uniformly affirms a close
relation between Peter and Mark, representing the latter to have
been the disciple and <i>interpreter</i> of the former. See
below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Papias (in Eusebius' Hist. Eccl. 3. 39) says, upon the authority
of John the Presbyter, "Mark being Peter's interpreter, wrote down
accurately as many things as he remembered; not, indeed, as giving
in order the things which were spoken or done by Christ. For he was
neither a hearer nor a follower of the Lord, but, as I said, of
Peter, who gave his instructions as occasion required, but not as
one who was composing an orderly account of our Lord's words. Mark,
therefore, committed no error when he thus wrote down certain
things as he remembered them. For he was careful of one thing, to
omit nothing of the things which he heard and to make no false
statements concerning them." These words of Papias are somewhat
loose and indefinite. But, when fairly interpreted, they seem to
mean that as Peter taught according to the necessities of each
occasion, not aiming to give a full history of our Lord in
chronological order, so Mark wrote not all things pertaining to our
Lord's life and ministry, but certain things, those namely that he
had learned from Peter's discourses, without always observing the
strict order of time. We need not press the words "in order" and
"certain things," as if Papias meant to say that Mark's gospel is
only a loose collection of fragments. It is a connected and
self-consistent whole; but it does not profess to give in all cases
the exact chronological order of events, nor to be an exhaustive
account of our Saviour's life and teachings. Eusebius has preserved
for us in his Ecclesiastical History the testimony of Iren&aelig;us
on the same point (Hist. Eccl., 5. 8); also of Clement of
Alexandria (Hist. Eccl., 6.14); and of Origen (Hist. Eccl., 6. 25).
He also gives his own (Hist. Eccl., 2. 5). We have besides these,
the statements of Tertullian (Against Marcion, 6. 25); and Jerome
(Epist. ad Hedib. Quaest., 2). All these witnesses, though not
consistent among themselves in respect to several minor details,
yet agree in respect to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page428"
id="page428"></a>{428}</span> two great facts, (1) that Mark was
the companion of Peter and had a special relation to him, (2) that
he was the author of the gospel which bears his name. We add from
Meyer (Introduction to Commentary on Mark) the following exposition
of the word <i>interpreter</i> as applied to Mark in his relation
to Peter: "No valid ground of doubt can be alleged against it,
provided only we do not understand the idea contained in the word
<i>interpreter</i> to mean that Peter, not having sufficient
mastery of the Greek, delivered his discourses in Aramaean, and had
them interpreted by Mark into Greek; but rather that the office of
a <i>secretary</i> is indicated, who wrote down the oral
communications of his apostle (whether from dictation, or in the
freer exercise of his own activity) and so became <i>in the way of
writing</i> his interpreter to others."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark's connection with the apostle Paul, though interrupted by
the incident recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (15:37-39), was
afterwards renewed and he restored to the apostle's confidence, as
is manifest from the way in which he notices him. Col. 4:10; 2 Tim.
4:11. If, as is probable (see below, No. 22), Mark wrote between
A.D. 60 and 70, his long intimacy with Peter and Paul qualified him
in a special manner for his work.</p>
<p>22. Ancient tradition favors the idea that Mark wrote his gospel
<i>in Rome</i>. Had he written in Egypt, as Chrysostom thinks, we
can hardly suppose that Clement of Alexandria would have been
ignorant of the fact, as his testimony shows that he was. In
respect to <i>date</i>, the accounts of the ancients differ so much
among themselves that it is difficult to arrive at any definite
conclusion. We may probably place it between A.D. 64 and 70. The
<i>language</i> in which Mark wrote was Greek. This is attested by
the united voice of antiquity. The subscriptions annexed to some
manuscripts of the Old Syriac, and that in the Philoxenian Syriac
version, to the effect that Mark wrote <i>in Roman</i>, that is, in
Latin, are of no authority. They are the conjectures of ignorant
men, who inferred from the fact that Mark wrote in Rome that he
must have used the Latin tongue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story of the pretended <i>Latin autograph</i> of Mark's
gospel preserved in the Library of St. Mark at Venice is now
exploded. The manuscript to which this high honor was assigned is
part of the <i>Codex Forojuliensis</i>, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>{429}</span> which
gives the text of the <i>Latin Vulgate</i>. The text was edited by
Blanchini in the appendix to his <i>Evangeliarium Quadruplex</i>,
<i>Fourfold Gospel</i>. The gospel of Mark having been cut out and
removed to Venice was exalted to be the autograph of Mark. See
Tregelles in Horne, vol. 4, chap. 23. The fact that Mark wrote out
of Palestine and for Gentile readers at once accounts for the
numerous explanatory clauses by which his gospel is distinguished
from that of Matthew. Examples are: chaps. 7:3, 4; 12:42; 13:3;
14:12; 15:42; and the frequent interpretations of Aramaean words:
3:17; 5:41; 7:11, 34; 10:46; 14:36; 15:34.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>23. The opening words of Matthew's gospel are: "The book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham,"
by which, as already remarked, he indicates his purpose to show
that Jesus of Nazareth is the long promised Messiah of David's
line, and the seed of Abraham, in whom all nations are to be
blessed. Mark, on the contrary, passing by our Lord's genealogy,
commences thus: "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the
Son of God." He recognizes him, indeed as the son of David, and the
promised Messiah and king of Israel. Chaps. 10:47, 48; 11:10;
15:32. But, writing among Gentiles and for Gentiles, the great fact
which he is intent on setting forth is the person and character of
Jesus as the Son of God. Matthew gives special attention to the
Saviour's discourses. With these considerably more than a third of
his gospel is occupied. Mark, on the contrary, devotes himself
mainly to the narrative of our Lord's works. With this is
interwoven a multitude of his sayings; since it was the Saviour's
custom to teach in connection with surrounding incidents. But if we
compare the set discourses of our Lord recorded by Mark with those
which Matthew gives, they will hardly amount to a fifth part in
quantity. Between the narrative parts of Matthew and Mark, on the
contrary, there is not a very great disparity in respect to the
space occupied by each.</p>
<p>24. Though Mark has but little matter that is absolutely new, he
yet handles his materials in an original and independent way,
weaving into the narratives which he gives in common with one or
more of the other evangelists numerous little incidents in the most
natural and artless way. His characteristics as a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>{430}</span> historian
are <i>graphic vividness</i> of description and
<i>circumstantiality of detail</i>. If we except some striking
passages of John's gospel, he brings us nearer to our Lord's person
and the scenes described than either of the other evangelists. He
brings before us, as in a picture, not only our Lord's words and
works, but his very looks and gestures. It is he that records as
has been often noticed, how the Saviour "looked round about" him
with anger on the unbelieving multitudes and on Peter (chap. 3:5;
8:33); with complacency on his disciples (chap. 3:34; 10:27); and
with the piercing look of inquiry (chap. 5:32); how he looked up to
heaven and sighed when he healed one who was deaf and dumb (chap.
7:34); and how he sighed deeply in spirit at the perverseness of
the Pharisees (chap. 8:12). He sometimes gives us the very words of
the Saviour when he performed his mighty works&mdash;<i>Talitha
cumi</i> (5:41), <i>Ephphatha</i> (7:34). His narratives are
remarkable for bringing in little incidents which can have come
from none but an eyewitness, but which add wonderfully to the
naturalness as well as the vividness of his descriptions. When the
storm arises he is asleep <i>on a pillow</i> (chap. 4:38); Jairus'
daughter arises and walks, <i>for she was of the age of twelve
years</i> (chap. 5:42); the multitudes that are to be fed sit down
<i>in ranks by hundreds and by fifties</i> (chap. 6:40), etc. As
examples of vivid description may be named the account of the
demoniac (chap. 5:2-20), and the lunatic. Chap. 9:14-27. It is not
necessary to assume that Mark was himself a disciple of our Lord.
If, as ancient tradition asserts, he was the disciple and
interpreter of Peter he could receive from his lips those
circumstantial details with which his narrative abounds.</p>
<p>25. The closing passage of this gospel, chap. 16:9-20, is
wanting in a number of important manuscripts, among which are the
Vatican and Sinaitic. The same was the case also in the days of
Eusebius and Jerome. But it was known to Iren&aelig;us, and quoted
by him and many others after him. The reader must be referred to
the critical commentaries and introductions for the discussion of
the difficult questions concerning <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page431" id="page431"></a>{431}</span> it. Tregelles, who, in his
account of the printed text has given a full statement of the case,
thus expresses his judgment (in Horne, vol. 4, p. 436): "It is
<i>perfectly</i> certain that from the second century and onward,
these verses have been known as part of <i>this gospel</i> (whoever
was their <i>author</i>)." He thinks that "the <i>book of Mark
himself</i> extends no farther than 'for they were afraid,' chap.
16:8; but that the remaining twelve verses, by whomsoever written,
have a full claim to be received as an authentic part of the second
gospel, and that the full reception of early testimony on this
question does not in the least involve their rejection as not being
a part of canonical Scripture."</p>
<h3>IV. LUKE.</h3>
<p>26. The unanimous voice of antiquity ascribes the third gospel
with the Acts of the Apostles to <i>Luke</i>. He first appears as
the travelling companion of Paul when he leaves Troas for Macedonia
(Acts 16:10); for the use of the first person plural&mdash;"we
endeavored," "the Lord had called us," "we came," etc.&mdash;which
occurs from that point of Paul's history and onward, with certain
interruptions, through the remainder of the Acts of the Apostles,
admits of no other natural and reasonable explanation. There is
good reason to believe that he is identical with "Luke, the beloved
physician," who was with Paul when a prisoner at Rome. Col. 4:14;
Philemon 24; 2 Tim. 4:11. From the first of these passages it has
been inferred that he was not a Jew by birth, since he is
apparently distinguished from those "who are of the circumcision,"
v. 11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tradition represents him to have been by birth a Syrian of
Antioch (Eusebius, Hist. Eccl., 3. 4; Jerome, Preface to Matt., and
elsewhere), and a Jewish proselyte (Jerome, Quest. on Gen., chap.
46); and it adds various other legends which are not worth
repeating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>27. The evangelist himself, in his dedicatory address to
Theophilus (chap. 1:1-4), gives us clear and definite information
respecting the <i>sources of his gospel</i>. He does not profess to
have been himself an eye-witness, but has drawn his information
from those "who from the beginning were eye-witnesses <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>{432}</span> and
ministers of the word." His investigations have been accurate and
thorough: "having accurately traced out all things from the
beginning" (as the original words mean), he writes to Theophilus
"in order;" that is, in an orderly and connected way. He proposes
to give not some loose fragments, but a connected narrative;
although, as we have seen above (No. 10), his order is not always
that of strict chronological sequence. From the long and intimate
connection of Luke with Paul it is reasonable to suppose that the
latter must have exerted an influence on the composition of this
gospel. Luke, however, did not draw the materials of his narrative
from Paul (at least not principally), but, as he expressly states,
from those "who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers
of the word." He did not write from Paul's dictation, but in a free
and independent way; though there is no reasonable ground for
doubting that it was with Paul's knowledge and approbation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "eye-witnesses and ministers of the word" are those who (1)
were from the beginning eye-witnesses of our Lord's public
ministry; (2) were intrusted with the work of preaching the word;
that is, the apostles and such of their associates as had companied
with them all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among
them. Acts 1:21. The words of Luke must not be strained; for he
records some incidents of our Lord's history <i>before</i> his
public appearance which could have been learned only from Mary and
her circle.</p>
<p>The remarkable agreement between Luke's account of the
institution of the Lord's Supper (Luke 22:9, 20), and Paul's (1
Cor. 11:28-25) has often been noticed. It is most naturally
explained by the supposition that Luke recorded the transaction in
the form in which he had often heard it from the lips of Paul. But
there is nothing in the character of this gospel which can warrant
the supposition that the apostle exercised a formal supervision
over its composition. Such a procedure would be contrary to the
spirit of the apostolic age. The apostle himself wrote by an
amanuensis. But when one of his associates in the ministry wrote,
in whom he had full confidence, he left him to the free exercise of
his judgment under the illumination of the Holy Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>28. In respect to the <i>date</i> of this gospel, if we assume
that the Acts of the Apostles were written at Rome about A.D. 63-65
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id=
"page433"></a>{433}</span> (Chap. 5, No. 5), it is reasonable to
suppose that the gospel, which is dedicated to the same personage,
was composed not very long before, perhaps even during the two
years of Paul's imprisonment at Rome, in which case Rome would also
be the <i>place</i> of its composition. Whether Luke wrote before
or after Mark is a question that has been differently answered, and
cannot be determined with certainty. The proof that all three of
the first evangelists wrote before the destruction of Jerusalem has
been already given. Chap. 3, No. 14.</p>
<p>29. Though Luke dedicates his gospel to Theophilus (chap,
1:1-4), it is not to be supposed that it was written for his use
alone. He had a more <i>general end</i> in view, and that is
indicated by the form of our Lord's genealogy as given by him.
While Matthew traces the Saviour's lineage through David to
Abraham, in conformity with his design to show that he is the
promised seed of Abraham and king of Israel, Luke traces it back
through David and Abraham to Adam "the son of God." He identifies
Jesus of Nazareth not with the Messiah alone of Abraham's and
David's line, but with man as man. He is the second Adam, and as
such the Saviour of the race. This <i>universal aspect</i> of the
gospel, as a gospel not for one nation but for all mankind, shines
forth indeed in all the gospels, but it appears with wonderful
sweetness and power in some of the parables which are peculiar to
Luke, as those of the good Samaritan (chap. 10:30-37), the lost
sheep (chap. 15:3-7), the lost pieces of silver (chap. 15:8-10),
the prodigal son (chap. 15:11-32); in all which Jesus is set forth
as the Saviour of suffering humanity.</p>
<p>30. As it respects the <i>character and plan</i> of Luke's
gospel, the following particulars are to be noticed. In the
distribution of matter between the narration of events and the
recital of our Lord's discourses it holds a position between the
first and the second gospel; being less full in the latter respect
than Matthew, but far more full than Mark. In the narrative part
there is an easy and graceful style which charms every reader. In
the introduction of minute incidents he goes beyond <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>{434}</span> Matthew,
though he has not the circumstantial exactness of Mark. The
agreement of Luke's gospel with the two preceding in its general
plan is recognized at once by every reader. Like them it is mainly
occupied with our Lord's Galilean ministry. In regard to the
Saviour's infancy he is more full than Matthew, the matter of the
first three chapters being in a great measure peculiar to him. He
omits a long series of events recorded by the first two
evangelists. Matt. 14:22-16:12; Mark 6:45-8:26. On the other hand
he introduces (chap. 9:43-18:30) "a remarkable series of acts and
discourses which are grouped together in connection with the last
journey to Jerusalem. Some of the incidents occur in different
connections in the other evangelists; and the whole section proves,
by the absence of historical data and the unity of its general
import, that a moral and not a temporal sequence is the law of the
gospels." Westcott, Introduct. to Gospel, chap. 7. Very much of the
matter in this remarkable section is peculiar to Luke, and contains
passages of wonderful beauty and sweetness which would have been
lost to the church but for the record of this gospel. Among these
are the mission of the seventy, several miracles, some striking
lessons of instruction from passing incidents, and no less than
twelve parables: the good Samaritan, the unfortunate friend, the
unclean spirit, the rich fool, the barren fig-tree, the lost sheep,
the lost pieces of silver, the prodigal son, the unfaithful
steward, the rich man and Lazarus, the unjust judge, the Pharisee
and publican. While the attentive reader perceives the very near
relationship of the third gospel to the first and second, he
notices also the fact that it differs from both of them more than
they do from each other.</p>

<p>[Westcott, after Stroud and Norton.]</p>
<p>Of absolutely new matter in Mark a striking example is the
beautiful parable, chap. 4:26-29. The two miracles peculiar to him
(chap. 7:31-37; 8:22-26) are both of a very striking character, and
related with circumstantial minuteness of detail. Where his
narratives coincide with those of the other evangelists, they are
characterized by the addition of details, which, as already
remarked, add much to the vivedness and graphic power of his
descriptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>31. The <i>integrity</i> of the third gospel has been recently
assailed in Germany in the way of attempting to show that the
gospel of Luke, as we now have it, is corrupted by interpolations,
and that Marcion had it in its true form. See Chap. 2, No. 12. But
the result of a voluminous discussion is that Marcion's gospel is
now acknowledged to have been a mutilated form of the canonical
gospel, in accordance with the testimony of the ancient
fathers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the relation to each other of the two genealogies of our Lord
given by Matthew and Luke respectively, and the different modes of
bringing them into harmony with each other, many volumes have been
written. Two different principles of interpretation are proposed.
According to the <i>first</i>, the genealogies of both Matthew and
Luke are those of <i>Joseph</i>, the legal father of Jesus, and the
only one that could be known in this relation in the public
registers. The <i>second</i> view is that Matthew gives the
genealogy of <i>Joseph</i>, and Luke that of <i>Mary</i>, Joseph
being called the son of Heli, in the sense of <i>son-in-law</i>;
and being perhaps also legal heir to Heli through Mary in the
absence of brothers. The reader will find statements of these two
views, the former in Smith's Bible Diet., the latter in Alexander's
Kitto, Art. Genealogy of Jesus Christ; also in the commentaries
generally. We only add that though we may not be able to determine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id=
"page436"></a>{436}</span> with certainty <i>what</i> is the true
solution of the difficulty, no one can show that such a solution is
impossible. The reverent believer will quietly wait for more light,
if it shall please God to give it; otherwise he will be content to
remain without it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>V. JOHN.</h3>
<p>32. Though the writer of the fourth gospel everywhere refrains
from mentioning his own name, he clearly indicates himself as the
"bosom disciple." When he speaks of two disciples that followed
Jesus, afterwards adding that "one of the two" "was Andrew, Simon
Peter's brother" (chap. 1:37, 40); of "one of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved" (chap. 13:23; 21:7, 20); and of "another disciple" in
company with Simon Peter (chap. 18:15, 16; 20:2-8), the only
natural explanation of these circumlocutions is that he refers to
himself. Even if we suppose, with some, that the two closing verses
of chapter 21 (the former of which ascribes this gospel directly to
John) are a subscription by another hand, their authenticity is
unquestionable, sustained as it is by the uniform testimony of
antiquity, and by the internal character of the gospel.</p>
<p>33. The Scriptural notices of John are few and simple. He was
the son of Zebedee, a fisherman of Bethsaida on the Western shore
of the sea of Galilee not far from Capernaum. Matt. 4:21; Mark
1:19, 20; Luke 5:10, 11. His mother's name was Salome. Matt. 27:56
compared with Mark 15:40. His parents seem to have been possessed
of some property, since Zebedee had hired servants (Mark 1:20), and
Salome was one of the women who followed Jesus in Galilee, and
ministered to him. Mark 15:40, 41. From the order in which he and
his brother James are mentioned&mdash;James and John, except Luke
9:28&mdash;he is thought to have been the younger of the two. Early
in our Lord's ministry he was called to be one of his followers;
was one of the three who were admitted to special intimacy with
him, they alone being permitted to witness the raising of Jairus'
daughter, the transfiguration, and the agony of Gethsemane (Matt
17:1; 26:37; Mark 5:37; 9:2; 14:33; Luke 8:51; 9:28); and of the
three was, though not first in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page437" id="page437"></a>{437}</span> place, first in the Lord's
love and confidence&mdash;"the disciple whom Jesus loved," and to
whose tender care he committed his mother as he was about to expire
on the cross. By his natural endowments, as well as by his loving
and confidential intercourse with the Saviour, he was prepared to
receive and afterwards to publish to the world, those deep and
spiritual views of Christ's person and office which so remarkably
characterize his gospel.</p>
<p>So far as we have any notices of John in the Acts of the
Apostles and epistles of Paul, his residence after our Lord's
ascension was at Jerusalem. But, according to the unanimous
testimony of antiquity, he spent the latter part of his life in
Ephesus, where he died at a very advanced age, not far from the
close of the first century. The subject of his banishment to the
isle of Patmos will come up in connection with the Apocalypse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a mass of traditions respecting the latter years of
this apostle, which are, however, of a very uncertain character.
Among the more striking of these are: his being taken to Rome
during the persecution under Domitian, and there thrown into a
caldron of boiling oil, whence he escaped unhurt; his refusal to
remain under the same roof with the heretic Cerinthus, lest it
should fall upon him and crush him; his successful journey on
horseback into the midst of a band of robbers to reclaim a fallen
member of the church who had become their leader; and especially,
that during the last days of his life, he was customarily carried
into the assembly of the church, where he simply repeated the
words: "Little children, love one another."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>34. The arguments for the <i>late composition</i> of this
gospel&mdash;after the destruction of Jerusalem&mdash;have already
been given. Chap. 2, No. 14. If we say between A.D. 70 and 100, it
will be as near an approximation to the time as we can make. The
<i>place</i>, according to Iren&aelig;us (in Eusebius, Hist. Eccl.
5. 8) was Ephesus, with which statement all that we know of his
later life is in harmony.</p>
<p>35. From the beginning of our Lord's ministry John was, as we
have seen, admitted to his intimate companionship and friendship.
He was not therefore, dependent on tradition. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>{438}</span> His
gospel is the testimony of what he had himself seen and heard. Yet
it covers only a <i>part</i> of the Saviour's ministry; and the
question remains why, with the exception of the closing scenes of
our Lord's life on earth, that part should be to so remarkable an
extent precisely <i>what the earlier evangelists have omitted</i>.
In answer to this question it might be said that those actions and
discourses of our Lord which John selected most clearly exhibit his
person and office as the son of God; and that these were
especially, (1) his encounters with the Jewish rulers at Jerusalem,
(2) his private confidential intercourse with his disciples.
Whatever weight we may allow to this consideration, it cannot be
regarded as a full explanation of the difference between John and
the other evangelists in the selection of materials. With the
exception of the miracle of the loaves and fishes and the incidents
connected with it (chap. 6:1-21) his notices of our Lord's ministry
in Galilee relate almost entirely to incidents and discourses
omitted by the other evangelists. It is altogether probable that,
although John did not write his gospel simply as supplementary to
the earlier gospels, he yet had reference to them in the selection
of his materials. His own statement: "Many other signs truly did
Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in
this book. But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus
is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have
life through his name" (chap. 20:30, 31), is not inconsistent with
such a supposition. The "many other signs" he may have omitted, in
part at least, because he judged that a sufficient account of them
had been given by the earlier evangelists, of whose writings, when
we consider the time that in all probability intervened between
their composition and that of his gospel, we cannot suppose him to
have been ignorant. Such a reference to these writings does not in
any way exclude the general design which he had, in common with the
earlier evangelists, to show "that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God," through faith in whose name eternal life is received.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id=
"page439"></a>{439}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>Ancient tradition represents, in a variety of forms, that John
intended to complete the evangelical history, as given by the other
evangelists, in the way of furnishing additional events and
discourses omitted by them. The citations may be seen in Davidson's
Introduct. to New Test., vol. 1, pp. 320-22. Though the statements
of the fathers on this point cannot be accepted without
qualification, there is no valid ground for denying the general
reference above assumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>36. In writing his gospel John had not a polemical, but a
<i>general end</i> in view. It was not his immediate aim to refute
the errors and heresies of his day; but, as he tells us, to show
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, in order that men,
through faith in his name, may have eternal life. Yet, like every
wise and practical writer, he must have had regard to the state of
the churches in his day and the forms of error by which they were
assailed. In the latter part of the apostolic age the seeds of
those heresies which in the following century yielded such a rank
and poisonous harvest, had already begun to be sown. Like all the
heresies which have troubled the Christian church to the present
day, they consisted essentially in false views respecting our
Saviour's person and office. The beloved disciple who followed
Jesus through the whole of his ministry and leaned on his bosom at
the last supper, has given us an authentic record of the Redeemer's
words and works, in which, as in a bright untarnished mirror, we
see both the divine dignity of his person and the true nature of
his office as the Redeemer of the world. Such a record was
especially adapted to refute the errors of his day, as it is those
of the present day. It is pre&euml;minently the gospel of our
Lord's person. It opens with an account of his divine nature and
eternal co&euml;xistence with the Father; his general office as the
creator of all things, and the source of light and life to all men
and his special office as "the word made flesh," whom the Father
sent for the salvation of the world, and by whom alone the Father
is revealed to men. Equality with the Father in nature,
subordination to the Father in office, union with human nature in
the work of redeeming and judging men, and in all <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>{440}</span> these
perfect union with the Father in counsel and will&mdash;such are
the great doctrines that run through our Lord's discussions with
the unbelieving Jews, as recorded by this evangelist. In the same
discussions, but more especially in his private confidential
intercourse with his disciples, he adds deep views of his relation
to the world, as the only revealer of God's truth, the only source
of spiritual life, and the only way of access to the Father; and to
believers, as the true vine, through vital union with which they
have life, nourishment, and fruitfulness. He unfolds also more
fully than the other evangelists the office of the Comforter, whom
the Father shall send to make good to the church the loss of his
personal presence. Thus the gospel of John becomes at once an
inexhaustible storehouse of spiritual food for the nourishment of
the believer's own soul, and a divine armory, whence he may draw
polished shafts in his warfare against error. This last record of
our Lord's life and teachings owes its present form, under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, partly to the peculiar character of
the writer, and partly to the lateness of the period when it was
composed. In both these respects we ought devoutly to recognize the
superintending providence of him who sees the end from the
beginning.</p>
<h3>VI. THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.</h3>
<p>37. The author of the Acts of the Apostles is identical with
that of the third gospel, as we learn from the dedication to the
same Theophilus. Chap. 1:1. Both are ascribed to Luke by the
unanimous testimony of the ancient church. The genuineness of this
book, its credibility, and the time of its composition&mdash;about
A.D. 63-65&mdash;have been already shown. Chap. 5, Nos. 2-5. It
remains to consider its <i>plan</i> and its <i>office</i> in the
system of revelation.</p>
<p>38. In respect to <i>plan</i> this book naturally falls into two
main divisions, the former embracing the first twelve chapters, the
latter the remainder of the work. The <i>first</i> division
contains the history of the apostolic labors after the ascension,
<i>in Jerusalem and from Jerusalem as a centre</i>. Here, if we
except <span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id=
"page441"></a>{441}</span> the events connected with the martyrdom
of Stephen (chs. 6, 7), the conversion of Saul (chap. 9:1-31), and
the Ethiopian eunuch (chap. 8:26-40), <i>Peter</i> everywhere
appears as the chief speaker and actor, being first among the
twelve, though possessing no official authority over them. It is he
that proposes the choice of one to supply the place of Judas, and
that is the foremost speaker on the day of Pentecost, at the gate
of the temple, before the Jewish Sanhedrim, and in the assembly of
the church. Chaps. 1:15-22; 2:14-40; 3:4-26; 4:8-12; 5:3-11, 29-32.
Associated with him we often find the apostle John. Chaps. 3:1;
4:13, 19; 8:14. When the Samaritans are to receive the gift of the
Holy Spirit, Peter and John are sent to them from Jerusalem. Chap.
8:14-25. When the gospel is to be carried for the first time to the
Gentiles, Peter is sent by the Holy Ghost to the house of Cornelius
in Cesarea (chap. 10), for which mission he afterwards vindicates
himself before the brethren at Jerusalem. Chap. 11:1-18. Further
notices of Peter we have in chaps. 9:32-43; 12:3-19. We know that
the other apostles must have been actively and successfully
employed in prayer and the ministry of the word (chap. 6:4), but it
does not come within the plan of this narrative to give a
particular account of their labors.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> division is occupied with the history of
<i>Paul's missionary labors among the Gentiles, from Antioch as a
centre</i>. He had already been sent from that city with Barnabas
to carry alms to the brethren in Jerusalem and Judea (chaps.
11:27-30; 12:25), when "the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas
and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them;" and they were
sent, with fasting and prayer and the solemn laying on of hands, on
their great mission to the Gentiles. Chap. 13:1-3. Thenceforward
the narrative is occupied with an account of the labors of Paul
among the Gentiles. The fifteenth chapter is no exception; for the
convocation of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem was occasioned
by the missionary labors of Paul, and had especial reference to
them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id=
"page442"></a>{442}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>Two cities are mentioned in the New Testament which have the
name of <i>Antioch</i>&mdash;<i>Antioch</i> of <i>Pisidia</i>
so-called, though situated in the southern part of Phrygia near the
border of Pisidia (Acts 13:14; 14:19, 21; 2 Tim. 3:11); and
<i>Antioch</i> of <i>Syria</i>, situated on the southern bank of
the Orontes about fifteen miles from its mouth. Acts 11:19-27;
13:1; 14:26; 15:22-35; 18:22; Gal. 2:11. The latter city was the
centre of Gentile Christianity. It was the metropolis of Syria, the
residence of the Syrian kings, and afterwards the capital of the
Roman provinces in Asia. Here the first Gentile church was
gathered, and the disciples first received the name of
<i>Christians</i>. Acts 11:19-26. Hence Barnabas and Saul were sent
to Jerusalem to bear alms (Acts 11:29, 30; 12:25); and afterwards
to consult the apostles and elders at Jerusalem on the question of
imposing the Mosaic law on the Gentile converts. From this city
also the apostle started on his three missionary journeys, and to
it he returned from his first and second journey. Acts 13:1-3;
14:26; 15:36, 40; 18:22, 23. From the time that Barnabas first
brought the apostle to Antioch (Acts 11:26) to that of his seizure
at Jerusalem and subsequent imprisonment, most of his time not
occupied in missionary journeys was spent at Antioch. Acts 11:26;
12:25; 14:26-28; 15:30, 35; 18:22, 23. As <i>Jerusalem</i> was the
centre for the apostles of the circumcision, so was <i>Antioch</i>
in Syria for the apostle of the Gentiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>39. This brief survey of the plan of this book gives us also an
insight into its <i>office</i>. First of all it gives us a fresh
and vivid portraiture of the apostolic labors and the spirit of the
apostolic church, as pervaded and quickened by the presence of the
promised Comforter. On the side of the apostles, we see a boldness
and ardor that no persecution can check, united with simplicity and
godly sincerity. On the side of the brethren, we see a
whole-hearted devotion to the Saviour, under the mighty impulse of
faith and love, which opens their hearts in liberality and causes
them to have all things in common. On the side of both the apostles
and the brethren, we see untiring activity and patient endurance in
the Master's service, such as make the primitive church a bright
illustration of the promise: "Thou shalt be like a watered garden,
and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. And they that be
of thee shall build the old waste places." Isa. 58:11,12. On the
side of the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles, on the contrary, we
behold, as ever since, a series of unsuccessful efforts to hinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id=
"page443"></a>{443}</span> the work of God; the very ringleader of
the persecutors being called, in the midst of his heat and fury
against Christianity, to be the "ringleader of the sect of the
Nazarenes." Such an authentic record of apostolic times is of
immense value to the church in all ages. It gives the true standard
of enlightened Christian zeal and activity, and the true exhibition
of what constitutes the real strength and prosperity of the
Christian church.</p>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles give also a cursory view of the
inauguration of the Christian church, by the descent of the Holy
Spirit in his plenary influences (chap. 2), by the appointment of
deacons (chap. 6), and the ordination of elders, though these last
are only mentioned incidentally (chaps. 14:23; 20:17), the office
being understood of itself from the usages of the Jewish Synagogue.
The scantiness of the information which we have on this matter of
church organization is a part of the wisdom of the Holy Ghost, and
is full of instruction to the church in all ages.</p>
<p>Once more, the Acts of the Apostles give a most interesting and
instructive account of the way in which "the middle wall of
partition" between Jews and Gentiles was gradually broken down. The
full import of the Saviour's last command: "Go ye into all the
world, and preach the gospel to every creature," seems to have been
at first but dimly apprehended by the apostles. For some time their
labors were restricted to their own countrymen. But when, upon the
dispersion of the disciples in the persecution that arose in
connection with Stephen's martyrdom, the gospel had been preached
to the Samaritans, the apostles Peter and John were sent to them,
and they in common with the Jews received the gift of the Holy
Spirit. Chap. 8:5-25. This was an intermediate step. Afterwards
Peter was sent among the Gentiles proper, and they also received
the Holy Spirit, to the astonishment of the Jewish brethren who had
accompanied Peter. Chap. 10. The same thing happened also at
Antioch (chap. 11:20), where the true reading is <i>Hellenas</i>,
<i>Greeks</i>, that is, <i>Gentiles</i>, not <i>Hellenistas</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id=
"page444"></a>{444}</span> <i>Hellenists</i>. But the work was not
yet finished. It remained that the believing Gentiles should be, by
the solemn and formal judgment of the assembled apostles and
elders, released from the yoke of the Jewish law. Of this we have
an account in the fifteenth chapter. Thus was the demolition of the
middle wall of partition completed. Of the greatness of this work
and the formidable difficulties by which it was
beset&mdash;difficulties having their ground in the exclusive
spirit of Judaism in connection with the false idea that the Mosaic
law was to remain in force under the Messiah's reign&mdash;we who
live so many centuries after its accomplishment can form but a
feeble conception.</p>
<p>40. Brief and imperfect as is the sketch which Luke has given
us, it is sufficient for the instruction of the churches in
subsequent ages. God deals with them not as with children, to whom
the command, "Touch not, taste not, handle not," must continually
be repeated; but as with full-grown men, who need general
principles rather than specific and minute directions. The facts
recorded in the Acts of the Apostles are of a <i>representative</i>
character. They embody the spirit of apostolic times, and the great
principles upon which the cause of Christ must ever be conducted.
Fuller information in respect to details might gratify our
curiosity, but it is not necessary for our edification.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>THE EPISTLES OF PAUL.</h3>
<p>1. The apostolic epistles are a natural sequence of the office
and work committed by the Saviour to the apostles. They were the
primitive preachers of the gospel, and, under Christ, the founders
of the Christian church. From the necessity of the case they had a
general supervision of all the local churches, and their authority
in them was supreme in matters of both faith and practice. It was
to be expected, therefore, that they should teach by writing, as
well as by oral instruction. It does not appear, however, that
epistolary correspondence entered originally into their plan of
labor. Their great Master taught by word of mouth only, and they
followed his example. "We," said the twelve, "will give ourselves
continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word." Acts 6:4.
It was only when circumstances made it necessary, that some of them
took up the pen to write to the churches. Passing by for the
present the disputed question of the time when the epistle of James
was written, and assuming that the conversion of Paul took place
about A.D. 36, we have an interval of at least sixteen years
between this event and the date of his earliest epistles, those to
the Thessalonians, written about A.D. 53. The apostles did not
regard themselves as letter-writers, but as preachers of the word.
They took up the pen only when some special occasion made it
necessary. The apostolic epistles are <i>incidental</i>; and for
this very reason they are eminently life-like and practical. In
respect to themes, and the manner of handling them, they present a
rich variety. All the great questions of faith and practice that
have agitated the Christian church since the apostolic age come up
for discussion in these letters, not indeed, in their ever-varying
outward forms, but in their great underlying <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>{446}</span>
principles. Thus the providence of God has provided in them a rich
storehouse of truths for the instruction and edification of
believers to the end of time.</p>
<p>2. Of the twenty-one epistles contained in the New Testament
<i>fourteen</i> belong to Paul (if we include the anonymous letter
to the Hebrews), all written in the prosecution of his great work
as the apostle to the Gentiles. The Saviour's personal ministry was
restricted to the Jews, and so was that of the twelve apostles and
the seventy disciples whom he sent forth before his crucifixion.
Matt. 10:5, 6; 15:24; Luke 10:1. But his last command was: "Go ye,
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Matt. 28:19. In
carrying into execution this command, which involved such an
immense change in the outward form of God's visible earthly
kingdom, it was necessary&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) That the apostles should insist very earnestly and fully on
the great fundamental doctrine of the gospel, that men have
justification and eternal life, not through the law of Moses, or
any other possible system of works, but <i>through faith in Jesus
Christ</i>; a doctrine which cuts up Pharisaism by the roots.</p>
<p>(2) That, since faith in Christ is the common ground of
justification for Jews and Gentiles, <i>both were to be admitted
upon equal terms</i> to all the rights and privileges of the
Christian church; the ancient prerogative of the Jews above the
Gentiles being done away in Christ.</p>
<p>(3) Still further, that since the Gentiles had justification and
salvation not through the law of Moses, but through faith alone,
<i>the Mosaic law was not to be imposed upon them</i>. This was
virtually announcing its abolition, its types and shadows having
been fulfilled in Christ.</p>
<p>(4) That this removal of "the middle wall of partition" between
the Jews and Gentiles was <i>in accordance with Moses and the
prophets</i>&mdash;not a change of God's original plan, but only
the full accomplishment of it. Acts 15:15-18; Rom. 3:21, 31;
4:6-25; Gal. 3:6-9.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id=
"page447"></a>{447}</span>
<p>We have seen how this great work was begun by the gift of the
Holy Spirit, in connection with the preaching of the gospel, first
to the Samaritans (Acts 8:5-17), and afterwards to the Gentiles
(Acts 10; 11:20-26, etc.); and how it was completed, so far as
concerns the <i>principles</i> involved in it, by the solemn decree
of the apostles and the elders (Acts 15:1-29).</p>
<p>3. But for the <i>realization</i> of these principles in the
actual preaching of the gospel to the Gentile nations, and the
establishment of Christian churches among them which should embrace
on equal terms Jews and Gentiles, a man of very peculiar
qualifications was raised up in the providence of God. Saul of
Tarsus was a Jew, brought up in Jerusalem at the feet of Gamaliel,
thoroughly instructed in the law and the prophets, and able
therefore to speak with authority concerning the Old Testament to
both Jews and Gentiles. His indomitable energy and fiery zeal,
united with rare practical wisdom, had made him the foremost man in
persecuting the Christians. When the proper time had come Jesus met
him on the road to Damascus with converting power, and all his
superior education and endowments were thenceforth consecrated to
the work of preaching the faith which once he destroyed, especially
to the Gentile world. But in this matter he felt and acted as a
Jew. He did not separate himself abruptly from his countrymen.
Cherishing towards them the tenderest affection, they were
everywhere the first objects of his Christian effort. Into whatever
city he went, he first sought the Jewish synagogue, and there he
"reasoned with them out of the Scriptures," Acts 13:14; 14:1; 17:2,
10; 18:4; 19:8. It was only when they persisted in opposing and
blaspheming, that he desisted from further effort among them and
turned to the Gentiles. Acts 13:45-47; 18:6; 19:9. Wherever he went
he encountered the bitterest persecution on the part of his own
countrymen, because of the prominence which he gave to the great
evangelical principles above considered&mdash;that men have
justification not wholly or in part through the Mosaic law, but
simply through faith in Christ, and that in him the distinction
between Jews <span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id=
"page448"></a>{448}</span> and Gentiles is abolished. Even the
believing Jews found it hard to apprehend these truths in their
fullness. In the narrowness of their Jewish prejudices they were
anxious to impose on the Gentile converts the yoke of the Mosaic
law. This, Paul steadfastly resisted, and it is to his defence of
Gentile liberty that we owe, in great measure, those masterly
discussions on the ground of justification, and the unity of Jews
and Gentiles in Christ, which are so prominent in his epistles. Yet
with his uncompromising firmness of principle he united remarkable
flexibility in regard to the means of success. To those who would
impose circumcision on the Gentiles he "gave place by subjection,
no, not for an hour." Gal. 2:5. But where no great principle was
concerned, he was willing to circumcise Timothy, out of regard to
the feelings of the Jews; thus becoming, in his own words, "all
things to all men." 1 Cor. 9:22.</p>
<p>4. The peculiar character of the apostle's style is obvious to
every reader. It is in an eminent degree argumentative. He
"reasoned with them," says Luke, "out of the Scriptures." These
words describe accurately the character of both his epistles and
his addresses to the Jews as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles.
In addressing a Gentile audience at Athens, he still "reasoned with
them;" but it was now from the inscription on one of their altars,
from certain of their own poets, and from the manifestations in
nature of God's power and Godhead. His reasoning takes occasionally
the form of an argument within an argument. He pauses by the way to
expand some thought, and does not return again to complete in
grammatical form the sentence which he had begun; so that his style
sometimes becomes complex and obscure. The versatility of the
apostle's mind, which made him equally at home in discussing
subjects the most varied, appears in his style also. It naturally
takes the complexion of his themes. To understand this one has only
to compare the epistle to the Romans with those to the Corinthians;
the epistle to the Galatians with that to the Ephesians; and all
these with the epistles to the Philippians and Thessalonians. His
style may be compared <span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id=
"page449"></a>{449}</span> to a clear window, which shows with
fidelity the ever varying forms and scenes that pass before it.</p>
<p>5. The commentaries that have been written on the epistles of
Paul would themselves constitute a large library. Our own century
has been very fruitful in them, and some of them are accessible to
every reader. For this reason our notice of the separate epistles
may well be brief. Our aim will be to give the occasion of each,
its chronological order in the series, its connection with the
apostle's missionary labors, its scope, and the office which it
accomplishes in the plan of revelation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In connection with Paul's epistles the reader should carefully
study the history of his life and labors, as given in the Acts of
the Apostles. From Acts 9:23-26 compared with Gal. 1:16-18, we
learn that the first three years after Paul's conversion were spent
at Damascus and in Arabia. Then he went up to Jerusalem, but after
a short sojourn there was driven away by the persecution of the
Jews, and retired to his native city, Tarsus in Cilicia. Acts 9:29,
30. After an interval of some time, which he spent "in the regions
of Syria and Cilicia" (Gal. 1:21), "Barnabas departed to Tarsus,
for to seek Saul. And when he had found him, he brought him unto
Antioch." Acts 11:25, 26. This is supposed to have been about A.D.
43, seven or eight years after his conversion.</p>
<p>Here begins his recorded public ministry <i>in Antioch and from
Antioch as a centre</i>. See above, Chap. 29, No. 38. It embraces
<i>three</i> great missionary tours (Acts 13:1, etc.; 15:36, etc.;
18:23, etc.), and <i>four</i> visits to Jerusalem besides that
already noticed. Acts 11:27-30 compared with 12:25; 15:2; 18:22;
21:15. The last of these ended in his captivity and imprisonment,
first at Cesarea and afterwards at Rome, with an intervening
perilous voyage and shipwreck. Acts chap. 21-28. See the incidents
of Paul's life chronologically arranged in Davidson's Introduct. to
New Test., vol. 2, pp. 110-112, with the annexed table; in Horne's
Introduct., vol. 4, pp. 490-495; in Conybeare and Howson, vol. 2,
Appendix 2; and in the commentaries of Hackett, Alford, Wordsworth,
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. As the epistles of Paul stand in the New Testament, they are
not arranged in chronological order. The principle of arrangement
seems to have been, first, those to <i>churches</i>, then, those to
<i>individuals</i>; the further order being that of <i>relative
size</i>, with this modification; that two epistles addressed to
the same church should stand together, and that the last of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id=
"page450"></a>{450}</span> them, which is always the shorter,
should determine their place in the series. Where the epistles are
about equal in size, it seems to have been the design to arrange
them chronologically. The catholic epistles are arranged upon the
same plan. The epistle to the Hebrews, as being anonymous, now
stands after those which bear the name of Paul. But in many Greek
manuscripts it is placed after 2 Thessalonians, consequently
between the epistles addressed to churches and those to
individuals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The student of these epistles should carefully note the
chronological order, because, as Wordsworth remarks (Preface to
Commentary on the Epistles), the mutual illustration which the Acts
of the Apostles and the apostolic epistles receive from each other
"is much impaired if the apostolic epistles are not studied in
connection with and in the order of the apostolic history." The
following is the chronological order of the epistles, as far as it
can be ascertained, though (as will hereafter appear) some
uncertainty exists in respect to several of them:</p>
<table summary="Dates of Epistles">
<tr>
<td>1 Thessalonians&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

<p>Arranged according to the order of time the thirteen epistles
which bear the name of Paul naturally fall into <i>four groups</i>:
(1) the two epistles to the Thessalonians, written during the
apostle's <i>second</i> missionary journey recorded Acts
15:36-18:22; (2) the epistles to the Galatians, Corinthians, and
Romans, written during his <i>third</i> missionary journey, Acts
18:23-21:15; (3) the epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians,
Philemon, and Philippians, written during Paul's imprisonment in
Rome, Acts 28:16-31 (some suppose the first three to have been
written during his imprisonment at Cesarea, Acts 23:35-26:32); (4)
the pastoral epistles, the first and third probably written after
his recorded imprisonment in Rome, and the second during a second
imprisonment after the publication of the Acts of the Apostles, and
which ended in his martyrdom A.D. 67 or 68.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The epistles of Paul will now be considered in the usual order,
except that the three to the Ephesians, Colossians. and Philemon,
which are contemporaneous, will be taken together.</p>

<h3>I. EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS.</h3>
<p>7. The <i>date</i> of the epistle to the Romans, as well as the
<i>place</i> where it was written, can be gathered with much
certainty from the epistle itself, taken in connection with other
notices respecting Paul found in the Acts of the Apostles. He was
about to bear alms to his brethren in Judea from Macedonia and
Achaia. Chap. 15:25, 26. He had previously exhorted the church of
Corinth in Achaia to make this very collection, which he was to
receive of them when he came to them through Macedonia. 1 Cor.
16:1-6. That he was also to bring with him a collection from the
Macedonian churches is manifest from 2 Cor. 8:1-4; 9:1-4. He wrote,
moreover, from Corinth; for among the greetings at the close of the
epistle is one from "Gaius mine host" (chap. 16:23), a Corinthian
whom he had baptized (1 Cor. 1:14); he commends to them Phebe, a
deaconess of the church at Cenchrea, the eastern port of Corinth,
chap. 16:1; and he speaks of "the city" where he is as well known
(chap. 16:23), which can be no other than Corinth. Now by comparing
Acts 19:21; 20:1-3; 24:17, we find that he was then on his way to
Jerusalem through Macedonia and Greece, for the last time recorded
in the New Testament. The epistle to the Romans, then, was written
from Corinth during the apostle's third missionary tour and second
abode in that city, about A.D. 58. It is the sixth of his epistles
in the order of time, and stands in near connection with those to
the Galatians and Corinthians, which were apparently written during
the previous year.</p>
<p>8. Concerning the founding of the church at Rome we have no
information. At the date of this epistle Paul had not visited it.
Chaps. 1:10-15; 15:23, 24. Of its <i>composition</i>, however, we
have more certain knowledge. Founded in the metropolis of the Roman
empire, where, as we know from many notices of ancient writers,
many Jews resided, it must have been of a mixed character,
embracing both Jews and Gentiles; with this agree the contents of
the present epistle. That the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page452" id="page452"></a>{452}</span> Gentile element largely
predominated in the church at Rome appears from the general tenor
of the epistle. Chaps. 1:13; 11:13-25, 30, 31; 15:16. That it had
also a Jewish element is plain from the whole of chap 2, and the
precepts in chap. 14.</p>
<p>9. The <i>occasion</i> of writing seems to have been of a
general character. The apostle had often purposed to visit Rome,
but had been as often hindered. Chap. 1:13. To compensate in part
for this failure, he wrote the present epistle, having, as it
appears, an opportunity to send it by Phebe, a deaconess of the
church at Cenchrea. Chap. 16:1. The apostle's <i>design</i>, like
the occasion of his writing, was general. It was natural that, in
addressing a church which he had long desired to visit, he should
lay himself out to unfold the gospel of Christ in its deep
foundation principles, as a plan of salvation provided for the
whole world, and designed to unite Jews and Gentiles in one
harmonious body, on the common platform of faith in Christ. He
first shows that the Gentiles are under the dominion of sin (chap.
1:18-32), and the Jews also (chap. 2), so that both alike are shut
up to salvation by grace. Chap. 3. He connects the gospel plan of
salvation immediately with the Old Testament by showing that
Abraham, the father of the Israelitish people, was justified by
faith, not by the works of the law or any outward rite; so that he
is the father of all who walk in the steps of his faith, whether
Jews or Gentiles. Chap. 4. He then sets forth the love of God in
Christ, who is the second Adam, sent to restore the race from the
ruin into which it was brought by the sin of the first Adam (chap.
5); and shows that to fallen sinful men the law cannot give
deliverance from either its condemnatory sentence or the reigning
power of sin, so that its only effect is to work wrath, while the
righteousness which God gives through faith in Christ sets men free
from both the curse of the law and the inward power of sin, thus
bringing them into a blessed state of justification,
sanctification, and holy communion with God here, with the hope of
eternal glory hereafter. Chaps. 6-8. Since the doctrine of the
admission of the Gentiles to equal privileges with the Jews, and
the rejection <span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id=
"page453"></a>{453}</span> of the unbelieving part of the Jewish
nation, was exceedingly offensive to his countrymen, the apostle
devotes three entire chapters to the discussion of this momentous
theme. Chaps. 9-11. He then proceeds to draw from the whole
subject, as he has unfolded it, such practical exhortations in
respect to daily life and conduct as were adapted to the particular
wants of the Roman Christians&mdash;entire consecration of soul and
body to God in each believer's particular sphere (chap. 12);
obedience to magistrates (chap. 13:1-7); love and purity (chap.
13:8-14); mutual respect and forbearance (chaps. 14:1-15:7). He
then returns to the great theme with which he began, that Christ is
the common Saviour of Jews and Gentiles, in connection with which
he refers to his office and labors as "the minister of Jesus Christ
to the Gentiles" (chap. 15:8-21), and closes with miscellaneous
notices and salutations (chaps. 15:22-16:27).</p>
<p>10. From the above brief survey the special <i>office</i> of the
epistle to the Romans is manifest. In no book of the New Testament
is the great doctrine of justification by faith so fully unfolded.
The apostle sets it in vivid contrast with the Pharisaical idea of
justification by the Mosaic law, and, by parity of reason, of
justification by every other system of legalism; showing that it is
only by grace through Christ that men can be delivered from either
the guilt of sin or its reigning power in the soul, while the
effect of the law is only to excite and irritate men's corrupt
passions without the power to subdue them. The place, therefore,
which this epistle holds in the understandings and affections of
believers must be a good measure of their progress in the Christian
life.</p>
<h3>II. EPISTLES TO THE CORINTHIANS.</h3>
<p>11. <span class="smcap">The first epistle to the
Corinthians</span> was written <i>from Ephesus</i>, not far from
the time of Pentecost (chap. 16:8); not from Philippi, according to
the subscription appended to it. It was during Paul's second and
last visit to that city, as we learn from his directions concerning
a collection for the saints at Jerusalem, and his promise to come
to the Corinthians through <span class="pagenum"><a name="page454"
id="page454"></a>{454}</span> Macedonia (chap. 16:1-5); for when
Paul left Ephesus after his second sojourn there he went by
Macedonia and Achaia (of which province Corinth was the capital) to
Jerusalem to bear alms. Acts 19:21; 20:1-3; 24:17. Paul's second
stay in Ephesus, during which time some think that he made a short
visit to Corinth not mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, which
would be the <i>second</i> in order, that promised in this and the
second epistle being the <i>third</i> (2 Cor. 12:14; 13:1),
extended over the space of about three years. Acts 19:1-10; 20:31.
From his words (chap. 16:3-8), we gather that the epistle was
written not long before the close of this period. Chronologists
generally place it about A.D. 57.</p>
<p>12. The <i>occasion</i> of his writing was more specific than
when he penned his epistle to the Romans. Corinth, the renowned
capital of the Roman province Achaia, situated on the isthmus that
connects the southern peninsula of Greece&mdash;the ancient
Peleponnesus and the modern Morea, and enjoying the advantage of
two ports was alike distinguished for its wealth and progress in
the arts, and for its luxury and dissoluteness of morals. Here the
apostle had labored a year and six months, and gathered a
flourishing church embracing some Jews, but consisting mostly of
Gentiles. Acts 18:1-11; 1 Cor. 12:2. These Gentile converts, having
just emerged from the darkness and corruption of heathenism (chap.
6:9-11), and living in the midst of a dissolute community (chap.
5:9, 10), did not wholly escape the contamination of heathenish
associations and heathenish vices. Chaps. 5, 6, 8, 10. Taking a low
and worldly view of the Christian church and the spiritual
endowments of its several members, they were led into party strifes
and rivalries. Chaps. 1:11-13; 3:3-7. Certain vain-glorious
teachers, moreover, had come in among them with a great show of
worldly wisdom, who disparaged Paul's apostolical standing, taught
the people to despise the simplicity of his teachings, and sought
to supplant him in the confidence and affections of the Corinthian
church. Chaps. 4, 9; 2 Cor. 10-13. In addition to this, certain
disorders and abuses had crept into their public assemblies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id=
"page455"></a>{455}</span> (chaps. 11, 12, 14), and some among them
denied the doctrine of the resurrection. Chap. 15. According to the
most probable interpretation of chap. 5:9, the apostle had already
written them a letter on some of these points which has not come
down to us, and the Corinthians themselves had written to the
apostle, asking his advice on some points of a practical character,
particularly in respect to the marriage relation in their present
state of trial. Chap. 7:1. The occasion, then, of writing this
epistle, which gives also its <i>scope</i> and <i>office</i>, was
to correct the above named errors and abuses, of which he had
received accurate information, and also to answer the inquiries of
the Corinthians in their letter. In this work the apostle employs
now sharp rebuke, now tender expostulation, and now earnest and
impassioned argument. The party strifes among the Corinthians he
meets by showing that Christ himself is the only head of the
church, that all gifts are from him, and are to be used to his
glory in the edification of believers. Chaps. 1:13, 14, 30, 31;
3:5-23. The vain-glorious boasting of their leaders he exposes by
showing the emptiness and impotence of their pretended wisdom in
comparison with the doctrine of Christ crucified, who is the power
of God and the wisdom of God for the salvation of all that believe,
without regard to the distinctions of worldly rank. Chaps.
1:18-2:16; 3:18-20. The abuses and disorders that had crept into
the church he rebukes with apostolical severity; and in correcting
them, as well as in answering the questions of the Corinthians, he
makes an application of the general principles of the gospel to the
several cases before him which is full of practical
wisdom&mdash;the incestuous person (chap. 5:8), companionship with
the vicious (chap. 5:9-13), litigation among brethren (chap.
6:1-8), fleshly indulgence (chap. 6:9-20), the inquiries of the
Christians in respect to marriage (chap. 7), meats offered to idols
and sundry questions connected with them (chaps. 8, 10), disorders
in the public assemblies (chap. 11), spiritual gifts with a
beautiful eulogy on love (chaps. 12-14), the doctrine of the
resurrection (chap. 15). He also defends his apostolical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id=
"page456"></a>{456}</span> character and standing against his
opposers, though by no means so earnestly and fully as in the
following epistle. Chaps. 4, 9. Thus it comes to pass that the
present epistle contains a remarkable variety of topics, and gives
us a fuller and clearer insight into the practical working of
Christianity in the primitive apostolic churches than that
furnished by any other of Paul's epistles, or, indeed, any other
book of the New Testament. The great principles, moreover, which he
lays down in meeting the particular wants of the Corinthian church
remain valid for all time; shedding from age to age a clear and
steady light, by which every tempest-tossed church may, God helping
it by his grace, steer its way into the haven of peace and
prosperity.</p>
<p>13. The reader cannot fail to notice the remarkable contrast
between the tone of this epistle and that to the Galatians, which
belongs in the order of time to the same group. See above, No. 6.
The errors of the Corinthians were not fundamental, like those of
the Galatians. They built upon the true foundation, Jesus Christ;
but marred the building by the introduction of base
materials&mdash;the "wood, hay, stubble" of human wisdom, instead
of the "gold, silver, precious stones" of the truth as Paul had
taught it. The false teachers among the Galatians, on the contrary,
sought to subvert the very foundations of Christianity by bringing
in a system of legal justification. In writing to the Galatians,
therefore, Paul contends, with apostolic severity, for the very
substance of the gospel, but in addressing the Corinthians, he
seeks only to purify the gospel from the admixture of human
additions.</p>
<p>14. <span class="smcap">The second epistle to the
Corinthians</span> was written not many months after the first,
<i>from Macedonia</i>, where the apostle was occupied in completing
a collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, with the purpose of
afterwards proceeding to Corinth that he might receive the
contribution of the Corinthian church also. Chaps. 8:1-4; 9:1-5.
Whether he wrote from Philippi, according to the subscription of
the epistle, or from some other place in Macedonia, cannot be
determined.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id=
"page457"></a>{457}</span>
<p>15. The <i>occasion</i> of writing was manifestly the report
which he had received from Titus (and as is generally inferred from
1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10, from Timothy also). He had sent Titus to
Corinth with the expectation that he would bring tidings thence to
Troas, where he hoped to find him on his way from Ephesus to
Macedonia. But in this he was disappointed. He therefore hastened
from Troas to Macedonia, where he met Titus and learned from him
the effect of his first epistle. Chaps. 2:12, 13; 7:6; 12:18. So
far as the main body of the Corinthian Christians was concerned,
this was highly favorable, and for it the apostle devoutly thanks
God (chap. 7:6, 7); commends their prompt obedience (chap. 7:11);
directs them to restore the excommunicated person (chap. 2:5-10);
and discusses very fully the matter of the collection for the poor
Christians at Jerusalem (chaps. 8, 9). But the very success of his
first epistle with the better part of the church had embittered his
enemies, and made them more determined in their opposition to him.
They accused him of levity in changing his original plan of
visiting the Corinthian church on his way to Macedonia (chap.
1:15-17); of uttering threats which he would not dare to execute
when present among them (chap. 10:9-11); of making a gain of them
by indirect means (chap. 12:16-18); and sought in various ways to
disparage his apostolical character and standing. This led him to
dwell with great earnestness on the fullness of his apostolic
credentials, the purity of his apostolic life, and the abundance of
his labors and sufferings in behalf of Christ's cause, always with
reference more or less direct to his enemies. With these personal
notices of himself are interwoven exalted views of the dignity of
the ministerial office, and the true spirit and manner in which its
weighty duties are to be performed. See chaps. 2:14-7:16; chaps.
10-13. The prominence which the apostle is thus forced to give to
his own person and labor constitutes the most remarkable feature of
the present epistle. To the same cause are due the peculiarities of
its diction, and its rapid transitions from one theme and tone to
another. "Consolation and rebuke, gentleness <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>{458}</span> and
severity, earnestness and irony, succeed one another at very short
intervals and without notice." Alford, Introduction to this
Epistle. All this came about by the wisdom of God, who placed his
servant in such circumstances that fidelity to the cause of truth
compelled him unwillingly to set forth in himself the character of
a true minister of the gospel in bright contrast with that of those
vain-glorious and selfish men, who under a show of great worldly
wisdom, seek to create parties in the church of Christ for their
own private honor and emolument. The particular occasion which
called forth this epistle soon passed away; but the epistle itself
remains a rich treasure for all believers, especially for all
Christian teachers.</p>
<h3>III. EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS.</h3>
<p>16. <i>Galatia</i> is the Greek word answering to the Roman
<i>Gallia</i>, that is, <i>Gaul</i>. It was one of the central
provinces of Asia Minor, and received its name from the
circumstance of its being inhabited by a people of Gallic origin
who came by the way of Byzantium and the Hellespont in the third
century before Christ. Two visits of the apostle to Galatia are
recorded in the Acts of the Apostles; the first, during his second
missionary journey (Acts 16:6); and the second, at the beginning of
his third journey (Acts 18:23). After which of these visits the
present epistle was written is a question that has been much
discussed, and answered in different ways. The most natural
interpretation, however, of chapter 4:13-16 leads to the conclusion
that it was after his <i>second</i> visit. The course of the events
seems to have been as follows: He was suffering from an infirmity
of the flesh when he preached the gospel to the Galatians "<i>at
the first</i>," that is, upon the first visit (verse 13). Then they
received him "as an angel of God, even as Jesus Christ," and were
filled with holy joy through simple faith in Christ's name (verses
14, 15). Upon his <i>second</i> visit he found it necessary to warn
them in very plain terms against the seductions of false teachers,
who were seeking to draw them away from the simplicity of the
gospel to faith in a system of works. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>{459}</span> But after
his departure these false teachers had great success; and the
result was that the affections of the Galatians were alienated from
Paul, who was their spiritual father. In view of this fact he asks
(as we may render v. 16, after Ellicott, in perfect accordance with
the idiom of the Greek): "So then, am I become your enemy, by
speaking to you the truth?" that is because in my recent visit I
told you the truth. According to this view the epistle belongs to
the second group, and was written about A.D. 56 or 57. Farther than
this we cannot go in determining the time. The <i>place</i> is
uncertain. It may have been Ephesus, or Corinth, which cities Paul
visited in his third and last missionary journey, but it cannot
have been Rome, as the subscription erroneously gives it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subscriptions are of no authority. That to the present
epistle probably had its ground mainly in chapter 6:17, where the
writer was erroneously supposed to allude to the bodily sufferings
that he endured in connection with his last recorded
imprisonment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>17. The <i>occasion</i> of this epistle, which gives also its
<i>design</i>, was very specific. The Galatian churches had begun
well (chap. 5:7); but soon after Paul's departure Judaizing
teachers had drawn them away to the very form of error noticed in
the Acts of the Apostles (chap. 15:1); "Except ye be circumcised
after the manner of Moses ye cannot be saved." They sought to
impose on all the Gentile converts circumcision as essential to
salvation. Thus they placed justification on a <i>legal</i> ground,
and made faith in Christ a subordinate matter. This error was
fundamental. Paul therefore attacks it with unsparing severity,
with which, however, he mingles a wonderful tenderness of spirit.
His argument is for substance the same as that in the epistle to
the Romans, only that it takes from necessity a more controversial
form, and is carried out with more warmth and vehemence of
expression. It is a divine model of the way in which fundamental
error should be dealt with.</p>
<p>18. The epistle naturally falls into three divisions. The
<i>first</i> is mainly <i>historic</i>. Chaps. 1, 2. The false
teachers had disparaged Paul's apostolical standing, on the ground,
apparently, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id=
"page460"></a>{460}</span> that he was not one of the original
twelve, and had not been called immediately by Christ to the
apostleship, but had received his gospel from men. It would seem
also that they labored to make it appear that Paul's doctrine
respecting circumcision and the Mosaic law was contrary to that of
Peter and the other apostles of the circumcision. Paul accordingly
devotes these two introductory chapters to a vindication of his
full apostolic standing. He shows that his apostleship is "not of
man neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father" (chap.
1:1); that the gospel which he preaches he neither received of man,
nor was taught by man but by the revelation of Jesus Christ (verses
11, 12); that, accordingly, upon his call to the apostleship, he
went not up to Jerusalem to receive instruction from those who were
apostles before him, but into Arabia, whence he returned to
Damascus (verses 15-17); that after three years he made a brief
visit of fifteen days to Peter, where he also saw James, but had no
personal acquaintance with the churches in Judea (verses 20-24);
that fourteen years afterwards he went up to Jerusalem by
revelation, not to be instructed by the apostles there, but to
confer with them respecting "the gospel of the uncircumcision"
which was committed to him, and that he obtained the full
recognition of "James, Cephas, and John, who were reckoned as
pillars" (chap. 2:1-10); and that afterwards, when Peter was come
to Antioch he withstood him to the face on this very question of
circumcision, because, through fear of his Jewish brethren, he had
dissembled and drawn others into dissimulation, adding also the
substance of the rebuke administered by him to Peter, which
contains an argument (drawn in part from Peter's own practice)
against compelling the Gentiles to live as do the Jews (verses
11-21).</p>
<p>Having thus vindicated his apostolic authority against the false
teachers in Galatia, he proceeds, in the <i>second</i> part of the
epistle, to unfold the great <i>argument for justification by faith
in Christ</i>. The Galatians have received the Holy Spirit, with
the accompanying miraculous gifts, not by the works of the law, but
by faith in Christ (chap. 3:1-5); Abraham was justified by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id=
"page461"></a>{461}</span> faith, as an example for all future ages
(verses 6-9,18); the law cannot bring justification to sinners, but
only condemnation (verses 10-12); from this condemnation Christ
delivers us, and makes us through faith the children of Abraham,
and heirs to all the promises which God made to him (verses 13,
14); the Abrahamic covenant, conditioned on faith alone, is older
than the Mosaic law and cannot be disannulled by it (verses 15-17);
the true office of the law was to prepare men for the coming of
Christ, in whom all distinction between Jew and Gentile is
abolished (verses 19-29); before Christ the people of God were like
a child that has not yet received the inheritance, but is kept
under tutors and governors, but through Christ they are like the
same child arrived at full age, and put in possession of the
inheritance (chap. 4:1-7). The apostle adds (chaps. 4:8-5:12)
various arguments and illustrations, with pointed allusions to the
false teachers who were subverting the simplicity of their faith in
Christ; and he solemnly warns the Galatian Christians that by
receiving circumcision they bind themselves to do the whole
law&mdash;the whole law as the ground of their justification. They
have left Christ, and thus fallen away from grace&mdash;forsaken a
system of grace for one of works, so that "Christ is become of no
effect" to them. Chap. 5:3, 4.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> part (chaps. 5:13-6:18) is of a
<i>practical</i> character. The apostle affectionately exhorts the
Galatians to use their Christian liberty in a worthy manner,
mortifying fleshly lusts, restoring fallen brethren in meekness,
bearing one another's burdens, and being diligent in every good
work. In bringing the epistle to a close he contrasts the
vain-glory and hypocrisy of these Judaizing false teachers with his
steadfast purpose to glory only in the cross of Christ, in whom
"neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a
new creature."</p>
<h3>IV. EPISTLES TO THE COLOSSIANS, EPHESIANS, AND PHILEMON.</h3>
<p>19. These three epistles are contemporaneous, in the sense that
they were written on the same general occasion, and forwarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id=
"page462"></a>{462}</span> at the same time, though some days may
have intervened between the composition of the first and the last
of them. They were all written when Paul was a prisoner (Eph. 3:1;
4:1; 6:20; Col. 4:10; Philemon 1, 9, 10, 23), and all sent
virtually by Tychicus; for Onesimus, a servant whom Paul sent back
to his master, Philemon of Colosse, with a commendatory letter,
went in company with Tychicus. Eph. 6:21, 22; Col. 4:7-9. The
epistle to the Ephesians contains no salutations; but those of the
other two, are, with a single exception, sent from the same
persons&mdash;Aristarchus, Marcus, Epaphras, Luke, and Demas. If
any further argument for their contemporaneousness were needed, it
could be found in the remarkable agreement between the contents of
the epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians, extending not only to
the thoughts but to the phraseology also.</p>
<p>20. It is agreed that these three epistles were written during
the apostle's imprisonment in either <i>Cesarea</i> or <i>Rome</i>;
but from which of these two places is a question on which biblical
scholars differ, and which cannot be answered with certainty,
though the common opinion has been that the apostle wrote from
Rome. It is not necessary to review the arguments advanced on the
two sides. The reader who wishes to investigate the matter will
find them in commentaries and bible dictionaries.</p>
<p>21. Another question is: In what <i>order</i> were the epistles
to the Ephesians and Colossians written? Here we have only indirect
indications, and these not decisive. It is manifest, however, from
a comparison of the two epistles, that the apostle had a more
specific occasion for writing to the Colossians than to the
Ephesians. It is natural, therefore, to suppose that he first
penned his letter to the former church, and very soon afterwards,
while his heart was yet warm with the great theme of that
letter&mdash;the personal glory and dignity of Christ, and the
union through him of both Jews and Gentiles in one holy
family&mdash;he wrote to the Ephesians among whom he had so long
labored, going over the same general course of thought, but with
more fulness and in a less argumentative tone. However <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>{463}</span> this may
be, it is certain that the most convenient order of studying these
two closely related epistles is to begin with that to the
Colossians and thence proceed to the other. We propose to consider
them in this order.</p>
<p>22. <span class="smcap">Epistle to the Colossians.</span>
Colosse was a city lying in the southwestern part of Phrygia, in
Asia Minor, in the neighborhood of Laodicea and Hierapolis. Chap.
4:13, 16. Respecting the founding of the church there we have no
information. According to the most natural interpretation of chap.
2:1, Paul had not visited Colosse in person when he wrote the
present epistle. The <i>occasion</i> of his writing seems to have
been information received by him that false teachers were troubling
the Colossian church. That these men were Jews is plain from chap.
2:16, 20, 21; where the reference is to Jewish ordinances. But
their doctrine was not simple Phariseeism, like that of the false
teachers among the Galatians. They did not seek directly to
substitute circumcision and the Mosaic law for faith in Christ, as
the ground of justification. They seem rather to have been
Christian Jews of an ascetic turn of mind, and imbued with the
semi-oriental philosophy of that day, which contained in itself the
seeds of the later Gnostic systems. Having no clear apprehension of
the glory of Christ's person and the fulness of the salvation which
his gospel offers to men, they sought to supplement the Christian
system by their ascetic practices and their speculations concerning
the orders of angels, whom they seem to have regarded as mediators
between God and men. To all this human philosophy the apostle
opposes directly the divine dignity and glory of Christ's person,
and the completeness of the redemption which he has provided for
men.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>Jewish</i> character of these false teachers appears in
their insisting on meats and drinks, holy-days, new moons, and
Sabbaths (chap. 2:16, 20, 21); their <i>ascetic</i> character, in
their doctrine concerning the mortification of the body (chap.
2:23); their <i>speculations concerning angels</i>, in the fact
that they are described as "delighting in humility and the worship
of angels" (chap. 2:18, 23). The apostle apparently refers to a
false humility which, under the pretence that God is too great to
be approached except <span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id=
"page464"></a>{464}</span> through the mediation of angels, made
them instead of Christ the way of access to him, thus disparaging
the Redeemer's person and office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>23. In respect to <i>plan</i>, the epistle naturally falls into
two parts of about equal length. The <i>first</i> is
<i>argumentative</i>. Chaps. 1, 2. After an introduction, in which
the apostle thanks God that the Colossians have been made partakers
of the gospel, commends them for the fruitfulness of their faith,
and assures them of his incessant prayers in their behalf (chap.
1:1-12), and passes to his great theme, which is to set forth the
divine dignity and glory of Christ's person. He is the image of the
invisible God, existing before all things, and the creator and
upholder of all things, those angelic orders included whom the
false teachers regarded as objects of worship (verses 15-17). He is
also the head of the church, and as such unites under himself all
holy beings in heaven and earth in one happy family (verses 18-22).
In him all fulness dwells, and all believers are complete in him;
receiving through him a spiritual circumcision which brings to them
holiness of heart, forgiveness of sins, and life from the dead
(verses 11-13). Christ has abolished by his death on the cross "the
handwriting of ordinances"&mdash;the Mosaic ordinances under the
figure of a bond which was before of binding force, but which he
has annulled&mdash;so that the former ground of separation between
Jews and Gentiles is done away (2:14). By the same death on the
cross he has "spoiled principalities and powers"&mdash;the powers
of darkness, of which Satan is the head&mdash;openly triumphing
over them (verse 15). The Colossians, then, have all that they need
in Christ, and the apostle affectionately warns them against being
spoiled through the philosophy of these false teachers, which is a
compound of ignorance, self-conceit, and will-worship, void alike
of reality and power.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> part is <i>practical</i>. Chaps. 3, 4. The
duties on which the apostle insists come mainly under two general
heads. The first is that of a <i>heavenly temper of mind</i>
growing out of their resurrection with Christ who sits at the right
hand of God, and who shall appear again to receive his disciples to
himself, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id=
"page465"></a>{465}</span> that they also may appear with him in
glory. In view of this animating hope he exhorts the Colossians to
put away all the sins belonging to their former state of
heathenism. Chap. 3:1-8. The second is that of <i>mutual love and
harmony</i> arising from their union with each other in Christ,
whereby they have been made one holy body, in which outward
distinctions are nothing "but Christ is all and in all." On this
ground they are urged to cultivate all the graces of the Spirit,
the chief of which is love, and faithfully to discharge, each one
in his station, the mutual duty which they owe as husbands and
wives, as parents and children, as masters and servants. Chaps.
3:9-4:1. They are admonished, moreover, to let the word of Christ
dwell in them richly for their mutual edification (chap. 3:16); to
be single-hearted in their aim to please Christ (verse 17); to be
prayerful and vigilant (chap. 4:2-4); and wise in their intercourse
with unbelievers (verses 5, 6). The epistle closes with notices of
a personal character intermingled with salutations (verses
7-18).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In chap. 4:16 the apostle directs that this epistle be read also
in the church of the Laodiceans, and that the Colossians likewise
read the epistle from Laodicea. What was this epistle from
Laodicea? (1) Some think it was a letter written by the church of
Laodicea to Paul, and forwarded by him to the Colossians. (2)
Others understand it of an epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans
(perhaps forwarded along with the three epistles now under
consideration) and which the Colossians were to obtain <i>from</i>
Laodicea. This is the most probable supposition. On the attempt to
identify this epistle with our canonical epistle to the Ephesians
see below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>24. <span class="smcap">Epistle to the
Ephesians.</span>&mdash;Ephesus, the metropolis of Proconsular
Asia, which comprehended the western provinces of Asia Minor, lay
on the coast of the &AElig;gean sea between Smyrna on the north and
Miletus on the south. In the apostolic age it was a flourishing
city, and renowned for the temple of the heathen goddess Diana. Two
visits of the apostle to Ephesus are recorded in the Acts of the
Apostles, the latter of which was prolonged through most of three
years. Acts 18:19-21; chaps. 19; 20:31. The <i>occasion</i> of
writing this epistle <span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id=
"page466"></a>{466}</span> seems to have been of a very general
nature. The apostle was sending a letter by Tychicus to the
Colossians, and embraced the opportunity to write to the Ephesians
also. In entire accordance with this supposition is the <i>general
character</i> of the epistle. The apostle has no particular error
to combat, as he had in the case of the Colossians. He proceeds,
therefore, in a placid and contemplative frame of mind to unfold
the great work of Christ's redemption; and then makes a practical
application of it, as in the epistle to the Colossians, but with
more fulness, and with some important additions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has seemed surprising to many that the apostle should have
written in so general a strain to a church on which he had bestowed
so much labor, and where he had so many personal friends;
particularly that he should have omitted at the close all
salutations. To account for this various hypotheses have been
proposed. The words "<i>in Ephesus</i>" are omitted in the Sinai
and Vatican manuscripts, and there is reason for believing that
they were wanting in some other ancient manuscripts not now extant.
See the quotations from Basil the Great, and other fathers in
Alford, Ellicott, Meyer, and other critical commentators. On this
ground some have supposed that the present epistle was intended to
be <i>encyclical</i>&mdash;an epistle for general circulation among
the churches; others, that it is the <i>Laodicean epistle</i>
referred to in Col. 4:16. But in favor of the words "in Ephesus"
there is an overwhelming weight of evidence. They are sustained by
all the versions and all the manuscripts except the above. Besides,
as every Greek scholar knows, if these words are omitted, it
compels the omission from the original of the two preceding words
which are found in every manuscript and version&mdash;unless,
indeed, we adopt the far-fetched hypothesis that the apostle
furnished Tychicus with two or more copies of the epistle for
different churches, leaving a <i>blank space</i> to be filled as
occasion should require; and then it becomes impossible to explain
how the reading "in Ephesus" should have been so universal in the
manuscripts and versions. There is no occasion for any of this
ingenuity. The omission of these words from single manuscripts is
not wonderful. It finds a parallel, as Alford remarks, in the
omission of the words <i>in Rome</i> (Rom. 1:7) from one
manuscript, whether from oversight or for the purpose of
generalizing the reference of its contents. Nor can any valid
objection be drawn from the general character of the epistle. That
depended much on the <i>occasion</i> which called it forth, which
we have seen to have been general, and the <i>frame of mind</i> in
which the apostle wrote. As to the omission of salutations, we
shall find upon examination that the measure of Paul's personal
acquaintance with the churches was not that of his personal
greetings. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id=
"page467"></a>{467}</span> These abound most of all in the epistle
to the Romans whom he had never visited. Rom. 16. They are found
also in the epistle to the Colossians to whom Paul was personally a
stranger. Col. 4:10-14. On the contrary they are wanting, except in
a general form, in the epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians,
Philippians, Thessalonians (in 2 Thessalonians wholly wanting as in
this epistle), Titus, and the first to Timothy. The other
objections are founded on misinterpretation, as when it is inferred
from chap, 1:15 that the author had never seen those to whom he
wrote; and from chap, 3:2 that they had no personal acquaintance
with him. But in the former passage the apostle speaks simply of
the good report which had come to him from the Ephesian church
since he left it; and, in the latter, the words: "if ye have heard"
imply no doubt (compare 1 Peter 2:3), and cannot be fairly adduced
to prove that the writer was personally unknown to his readers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>25. This epistle, like that to the Colossians, naturally falls
into two divisions of about equal size; the first
<i>argumentative</i>, the second <i>practical</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>argumentative</i> part occupies the first two chapters.
Full of the great theme with which the epistle to the Colossians is
occupied&mdash;the personal dignity and glory of Christ, the
greatness of his salvation, and especially the union through him of
all holy beings in heaven and earth in one family of God&mdash;the
apostle begins, immediately after the apostolic greeting, by
pouring out his heart in thanksgiving to God for his rich mercy,
which has made him and his beloved Ephesians partakers of Christ's
redemption, the greatness and glory of which he describes in
glowing terms, bringing in, as he proceeds, the thought with which
his mind is filled, that it is God's purpose to "gather together in
one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are
on earth." Chap. 1:10. He then adds a fervent prayer for the growth
of the Ephesians in the knowledge of Christ, whom God has raised
above all principality and power and made head over all things to
his body the church. Returning in the second chapter to the theme
with which he began, he contrasts with the former wretched
condition of the Ephesians, when they had no hope and were without
God in the world, their present blessed state, as fellow-citizens
with the saints and of the household of faith; God having through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id=
"page468"></a>{468}</span> Christ broken down the middle wall of
partition between Jews and Gentiles, and built them all into a holy
temple upon one common foundation, of which Jesus Christ is the
chief corner stone. In the third chapter he dwells upon the grace
of God which had committed to him, in a special sense, the office
of preaching among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
and adds a rapturous prayer for the strengthening of the Ephesians
through the Spirit in the inner man, for their establishment in
faith and love, and their illumination in the love of Christ which
passes knowledge, that they may "be filled with all the fulness of
God." Then follows a doxology in which the apostle labors to find
words wherewith to express his conception of the greatness of God's
power and grace through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>With the fourth chapter begins the <i>practical</i> part of the
epistle. He begins with an exhortation to unity, the argument for
which cannot be abridged: "There is one body, and one Spirit, even
as ye are called in one hope of your calling: one Lord, one faith,
one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and
through all, and in you all." Chap. 4:4-6. He next speaks of the
diversity of gifts among believers, all of which come from Christ,
and have for their end the unity of the church in faith and
knowledge, and thus her stability (verses 7-16). Then follow
earnest admonitions to shun the vices of their former state of
heathenism, and cultivate all the graces of the Spirit. The mutual
relations of life are then taken up, as in the epistle to the
Colossians. Here occurs that grand digression in which the love of
Christ towards his church is compared with that of the husband
towards his wife. Chap. 5:23-32. The closing exhortation, in which
the Christian is compared to a warrior wrestling not with flesh and
blood but with the powers of darkness, and his heavenly panoply is
described at length, is (with the exception of the brief figure, 1
Thess. 5:8) peculiar to this epistle and is very striking.</p>
<p>26. <span class="smcap">Epistle to Philemon.</span>&mdash;This
short epistle is essentially of a private character. It was sent to
Colosse by Onesimus at <span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id=
"page469"></a>{469}</span> the same time with the epistle to the
Colossians, of which Tychieus was the bearer. Col. 4:7-9. The
epistle itself plainly indicates its object. It is a plea for
Onesimus, the servant of Philemon, who had left his master and
apparently defrauded him (verse 18), but now returns to him a
Christian. As a model of Christian delicacy and courtesy it has
been the admiration of all ages.</p>
<h3>V. EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.</h3>
<p>27. The ancient name of Philippi was <i>Crenides</i>
(<i>Fountains</i>); but Philip of Macedon fortified the place and
called it after his own name. It lay along the bank of a river on a
plain in the eastern border of Proconsular Macedonia, and was made
a colony by Augustus in memory of his victory gained there over
Brutus and Cassius. Compare Acts 16:12. Its port was Neapolis on
the &AElig;gean sea about twelve Roman miles to the southeast of
it. Philippi was the first place in Europe where the gospel was
preached by Paul, who had been summoned across the sea to Macedonia
by a vision. Acts 16:9. This was during his second missionary
journey, about A.D. 53. A record of his labors and sufferings on
that occasion is given in Acts 16:12-40. In his third missionary
journey he twice visited Macedonia, sailing the second time from
Philippi, that is, from its port Neapolis. Acts 20:1, 3-6.</p>
<p>28. The <i>occasion</i> of this epistle seems to have been the
contribution made by the Philippians to supply the apostle's
necessities while a prisoner in Rome. Chap. 4:10-18. That he was a
prisoner is plain from chap. 1:13, 14, 16. That the <i>place</i> of
imprisonment was Rome is inferred from the general tone of the
epistle, which shows that the apostle was awaiting a decision of
his case, in accordance with his appeal to C&aelig;sar, with the
confident expectation of a favorable result (chaps. 1:19-25; 2:23,
24), and especially from the mention of C&aelig;sar's household
(chap. 4:22). From chap. 2:23, 24 we infer, moreover, that the time
for a decision of his case was at hand. The date of this epistle,
then, was about A.D. 63.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id=
"page470"></a>{470}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>The apostle speaks very confidently of a speedy release and
restoration to the work of his apostolic office. Chaps. 1:19, 25,
26; 2:24. This language is important in connection with the two
closely related questions, that of a second imprisonment at Rome
and that of the date of the pastoral epistles. See below, No.
35.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>29. The <i>character</i> of this epistle answers well to its
occasion. It is a free outpouring of the apostle's heart towards
his beloved Philippians, who had remembered him in his bonds and
sent Epaphroditus to supply his wants. He bestows upon them no
censure, unless the suggestion to Euodias and Syntyche be regarded
as such, but commends them for their liberality, exhorts them to
steadfastness in the endurance of persecution, and admonishes them
to maintain a deportment which shall be in all things such as
becomes the gospel, the several parts of which he specifies in the
course of the epistle, but not in any very exact order. It is in
connection with these admonitions that the apostle, while insisting
on the duty of humility and self-sacrificing love, brings in that
sublime description of the Saviour's original glory and equality
with God, which he laid aside for our redemption, taking upon
himself the form of a servant and submitting to the death of the
cross; for which act of self-abasement he is now exalted to be Lord
of heaven and earth. Chap. 2:5-11. Intermingled with the above
named commendations, exhortations, and counsels, are frequent
notices respecting himself, introduced in the most natural and
artless manner, and unfolding for our edification some of the
deepest principles of Christian character.</p>
<p>His faith in Christ and love for His cause raise him above the
sphere of human jealousies. He rejoices that Christ is preached,
whether of good-will or of envy, knowing that this shall turn to
his salvation through the prayers of the Philippians and the supply
of Christ's Spirit. Chap. 2:15-19.</p>
<p>He knows that for himself personally it is better to depart and
be with Christ: but to continue in the flesh is more needful for
the Philippians. He cannot, therefore, choose between life and
death. Chap. 1:21-25. How different this from the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id=
"page471"></a>{471}</span> of some, who think of death only in
connection with their own personal comfort, and how much higher the
type of religion which it reveals!</p>
<p>So far as outward advantages are concerned, no man can have more
occasion than he to glory in the flesh. But all these he has
renounced and counted loss for Christ. His one ambition is to know
Christ, and be united with him in his death and resurrection. His
present attainments he forgets in his single purpose of pressing
towards the goal for the prize of God's heavenly calling in Christ
Jesus. Chap. 3:4-14.</p>
<p>He warmly commends the Philippians for their liberality, but
wishes them to understand that he does not speak in respect to
personal want; for every where and in all things he has been taught
the lesson of contentment with present circumstances. Chap.
4:10-14.</p>
<h3>VI. EPISTLES TO THE THESSALONIANS.</h3>
<p>30. The original name of Thessalonica was <i>Therme</i>, whence
the gulf at the head of which it is situated, was called the
Thermaic gulf. The modern name of the city is <i>Saloniki</i>, and
of the gulf, the gulf of Saloniki. In the apostolic age it was a
large and wealthy city, and the metropolis of the second district
of Macedonia. At the present day it is second only to
Constantinople in European Turkey. Then as now a large number of
Jews resided in it. In his second missionary tour the apostle, when
driven from Philippi, went through Amphipolis and Apollonia to
Thessalonica. After his usual manner he first resorted to the
Jewish synagogue "and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of
the Scriptures." After this a tumult was raised at the instigation
of the unbelieving Jews, and the apostle was sent away by night to
Berea. Acts 17:1-10. We cannot affirm that his stay at Thessalonica
was limited to three weeks; yet it was very brief, and for this
reason he was anxious to return again that he might impart further
instruction and consolation to the converts there, who were
undergoing a severe ordeal of temptation through persecution.
Chaps. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id=
"page472"></a>{472}</span> 2:17-3:5. His labors at Thessalonica
were not confined to the Sabbath-day and the Jewish synagogue. He
preached the gospel to the Gentiles also, and his chief success
seems to have been among them. 1 Thess. 1:9; 2:14, 16.</p>
<p>31. <span class="smcap">The First Epistle to the
Thessalonians</span> was written during the apostle's <i>second</i>
missionary journey, the same journey in which he first visited
Thessalonica. This we gather from the fact that Silvanus (Silas)
was with him (chap. 1:1), for Silas was Paul's travelling companion
only during that journey (Acts 15:40; 16:19, 25, 29; 17:4, 10, 14,
15; 18:5); also from the notice of his being at Athens (chap. 3:1
compared with Acts 17:15, 16). He did not, however, write from
Athens, as the subscription erroneously states, but from
<i>Corinth</i>; for it was at this place that Silas and Timotheus
rejoined him, bringing good tidings from Macedonia respecting the
church in Thessalonica. Chap. 3:1-6 compared with Acts 18:1-5. This
is, then, <i>the earliest of Paul's epistles</i>, having been
written about A.D. 53.</p>
<p>32. The epistle clearly indicates its <i>occasion</i>. In
consideration of the brief time which the apostle had been able to
spend at Thessalonica, and of the severe persecution to which the
converts in that city were exposed, he was very desirous to make
them a second visit. But having been twice frustrated in this
purpose, he sent Timothy and Silas to learn the condition of the
Thessalonian church and bring him word concerning it, which they
did while he was at Corinth. Chaps. 2:17-3:6. The letter is an
affectionate outpouring of his heart in view of the good tidings
received through these brethren, into which are interwoven
encouragements, instructions, and admonitions adapted to the
circumstances of the brethren at Thessalonica, with abundant
references to the apostle's own labors there. In the first chapter
he commends, with devout thanksgiving to God, the faith and love
and patience of the Thessalonian Christians. The second and third
chapters are mainly occupied with a notice of his own labors and
those of his colleagues at Thessalonica, of his strong desire to
revisit them which he had thus far <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page473" id="page473"></a>{473}</span> been hindered from carrying
into execution, and of his joy at the good tidings brought by
Timothy, the whole closed with a fervent prayer in their behalf.
The two remaining chapters contain miscellaneous instructions
suited to the condition of a church that had been recently gathered
in great part from the ranks of heathenism. In the course of these
he corrects an error into which the Thessalonian believers had
fallen from the idea that they who should die before Christ's
second coming might fail of their share in its glory and
blessedness. Chap. 4:13-18. In both of the epistles he admonishes
the Thessalonians against the neglect of their proper worldly
business, a fault that was apparently connected with visionary
ideas respecting the speedy second coming of our Lord, and which he
rebukes in severe terms. 1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:10-12.</p>
<p>33. <span class="smcap">The second epistle to the
Thessalonians</span>, like the first, is written in the name of
"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus," and seems to have been sent
from <i>Corinth</i> not many months after the first. The apostle's
main <i>design</i> was to correct a pernicious error respecting the
time of our Lord's second advent, which some at Thessalonica seem
to have been strenuously engaged in propagating, and to give them
further instruction respecting this great doctrine and their duty
in relation to it. After the apostolic salutation he expresses his
gratitude to God for the growth of their Christian faith and love,
and comforts them under the pressure of the persecution to which
they were subjected with the assurance of our Lord's second coming
in glory to destroy his and their enemies and give rest to his
suffering servants; but proceeds in the second chapter to show that
this day is not yet at hand, and cannot come till there has first
been a great apostacy, the characteristic features of which he
proceeds to give (verses 3-12). The remainder of the epistle is
occupied with commendations and encouragements to perseverence,
mingled with admonitions. The latter have special reference to
certain idle and disorderly members of the church, whom the apostle
describes as "some which walk among you disorderly, working not at
all, but are busy bodies" (chap. 3:11), <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>{474}</span> and who
also set themselves in opposition to his apostolic authority (verse
14). These disorderly persons seem to have been the same as those
who were engaged in propagating erroneous notions respecting the
time of our Lord's second advent. Their visionary views on this
subject made them self-conceited, talkative, and self-willed, and
led them to neglect the sober duties of daily life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The apostle beseeches the Thessalonians not to be soon shaken in
mind, or troubled, "neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter
as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand." And he adds:
"Let no man deceive you in any way"&mdash;in any of the ways
specified or any other way. Chap. 2:2, 3. There were then persons
at Thessalonica busily occupied in misleading the Thessalonians:
(1) "by spirit," that is, by prophesies which they professed to
have received from the Holy Spirit; (2) "by word," by oral
teaching; (3) "by letter as from us," that is, purporting to come
from the apostle. Or, perhaps, we should render: "nor by word nor
by letter as from us:" that is, neither by oral teaching nor by
written communication alleged to have come from me. We can well
understand how the unwritten words of the apostle should have been
perverted by these false teachers. The question remains: Did they
pervert the meaning of his language in the first epistle, or did
they employ an epistle forged in his name? The latter has been from
ancient times a common interpretation of this clause, and it is
favored by the words: "The salutation of Paul with mine own hand,
which is the token in every epistle: so I write." Chap. 3:17. Yet
the supposition of such a forged epistle is something so improbable
that many are inclined to adopt the former supposition.</p>
<p>The question respecting "the man of sin" belongs to the
commentator. In a brief introduction like the present, we cannot
enter upon it farther than to say that, though we are not warranted
in affirming that it has its exhaustive fulfilment in the Papacy,
yet its chief embodiment thus far has been in that corrupt and
persecuting power whose character answers so remarkably to the
apostle's description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>34. The epistles to the churches of Philippi and Thessalonica,
both lying within the bounds of ancient Macedonia, have a
remarkable agreement in their general tone and manner. In both
cases we have the same affectionate outpouring of the apostle's
heart towards the brethren to whom he writes, and the same abundant
personal notices respecting himself and his ministry. Yet they
differ precisely as we might suppose they would <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>{475}</span> in view
of the fact that the two to the Thessalonians are the earliest of
Paul's writings, and are separated from that to the Philippians by
an interval of ten eventful years. In writing to the Thessalonians
he gives peculiar prominence to the doctrine of our Lord's second
coming, perhaps because, in the persecutions which they were
undergoing, they especially needed its strengthening and
consolatory influence; perhaps also because in the continual
maltreatment which he had encountered ever since he entered
Macedonia&mdash;at Philippi (Acts 16:19-40; 1 Thess. 2:2), at
Thessalonica (Acts 17:5-10), at Berea (Acts 17:13, 14), at Corinth
(Acts 18:6-17)&mdash;he was staying his own soul on the same
glorious hope. On the contrary, we find in these earlier epistles
no mention of Judaizing Christians, nor any contrast between the
two opposite systems of justification by faith and by the works of
the Mosaic law, such as appears in his later epistles, that to the
Philippians included. Phil. 3:4-9. His opponents at Thessalonica
are not Judaizing Christians, but unconverted Jews, whose malignant
opposition he describes in strong terms. 1 Thess. 2:15, 16. To the
Thessalonians the apostle speaks of himself; but it is of his
ministry, and the manner in which he has discharged its duties
among them. To the Philippians he also speaks of himself; but then
it is from a prison, with a trial for life or death before him, and
the retrospect of a long ministry behind him. He unfolds,
therefore, as is natural, his deep experiences as a Christian and
an apostle of Christ. See above, No. 29. In this contrast between
the earlier and the later epistles we have an evidence of their
genuineness which is all the stronger because of its indirectness.
It is such a mark of truth as no falsifier has power to
imitate.</p>
<h3>VII. THE PASTORAL EPISTLES.</h3>
<p>35. The attempt to find for the pastoral epistles a place in
Paul's ministry as far as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles is
beset with difficulties which amount to impossibilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among these difficulties are the following:</p>
<p>(1.) Whoever carefully studies these three epistles in their
connection <span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id=
"page476"></a>{476}</span> with each other, and in contrast with
the other Pauline epistles, must be profoundly impressed with the
conviction that they all belong, as it respects style and tone of
thought, to the same period of the apostle's life; and, as it
respects subject-matter, to the same era when the churches were
troubled by the same forms of error. But if we assume that they
were written during that part of Paul's ministry of which Luke has
left us the record, the second to Timothy must be widely separated
from the other two. That was certainly written during Paul's last
imprisonment near the close of his life. But when he wrote the
first to Timothy and that to Titus he was at liberty and
prosecuting his missionary labors in Asia Minor and the vicinity.
It must have been then, upon this assumption, during his third
missionary tour (when Apollos appears for the first time, Acts
18:24 compared with Titus 3:13), and before his last recorded
journey to Jerusalem, his arrest there, his two years' imprisonment
at Cesarea, his voyage to Rome, and his imprisonment there for the
space of at least two more years.</p>
<p>(2.) There is no part of Paul's history "between his first visit
to Ephesus and his Roman imprisonment, which satisfies the
historical conditions implied in the statements of any one of these
epistles." Conybeare and Howson, vol. 2, Appendix 1. The student
may see the arguments on one side in Davidson's Introduction to the
New Testament; and on the other in Alford, and other critical
commentators. Reference may also be made to the biblical
dictionaries.</p>
<p>(3.) Upon the assumption that the first epistle to Timothy, whom
Paul had left in charge of the Ephesian church, was written
<i>before</i> his recorded imprisonments at Cesarea and Rome, it
must be earlier than his farewell address to the elders of Ephesus,
and also his epistle to the Ephesians. But the contents of the
epistle manifestly point to a later period, when the errors in
doctrine and practice which he had predicted (Acts 20:29, 30), but
of which he takes no notice in his epistle to the Ephesians, had
already begun to manifest themselves. The more one compares with
each other these two epistles, the deeper must his conviction be
that the first to Timothy is not the earlier but the later of the
two.</p>
<p>(4.) The peculiar tone and diction of the pastoral epistles and
the peculiar character of the errors combated in them all indicate
a later period in the apostle's life, and a later stage in the
history of the churches. To place the first and third of these
among those to the Galatians, Corinthians, and Romans, and the
second, among those to Philemon, the Colossians, Ephesians, and
Philippians, must appear forced and unnatural. It is much easier to
assume the lapse of some years. Even then the contrast between
these and the other epistles of Paul in respect to tone and diction
is very striking. But it may be explained partly from the peculiar
theme of the pastoral epistles, partly from the change which the
lapse of time <span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id=
"page477"></a>{477}</span> with its manifold experiences had
brought to the apostle's style and diction.</p>
<p>We assume, therefore, that the apostle was released from the
Roman imprisonment recorded by Luke; and that, not very long before
his second imprisonment which was terminated by his martyrdom at
Rome, he wrote the three epistles now under consideration. It is
well known that this is in accordance with ancient tradition. See
the testimonies in Conybeare and Howson, chap. 27; in Alford, and
in other commentators.</p>
<p>Against this view is urged the apostle's declaration to the
elders of Ephesus that they should see his face no more; whereas,
according to the present supposition, he visited Ephesus
<i>again</i> after his first imprisonment. As a fair offset to this
may be urged on the other side his equally strong declaration to
the Philippians that his present imprisonment should have a
favorable issue (Phil. 1:25); which was not the case upon the
hypothesis of a single imprisonment at Rome. Such declarations,
where no doctrine or fact of Christianity is concerned, are not to
be taken as revelations of the Spirit. We know, for example, from
Paul's own words, that he changed his declared purpose respecting a
visit to Corinth, for which his enemies accused him of using
lightness. 2 Cor. 1:15-18.</p>
<p>It is urged again that when Paul wrote the pastoral epistles
Timothy was a <i>young man</i>. 1 Tim. 4:12; 2 Tim. 2:22. But
according to ancient ideas one might be called a young man at any
age under thirty-five or even forty years. Paul found Timothy in
his second missionary journey, about A.D. 52. It is not necessary
to assume that he was then more than twenty years old. At the time
of Paul's martyrdom, then, about A.D. 67 or 68, he may have been,
for anything that appears to the contrary, a young man in the
ancient sense of the word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>36. The false teachers with whom the apostle deals in these
epistles are corrupt in <i>practice</i> as well as in doctrine. 1
Tim. 1:6; 6:5; 2 Tim. 2:16, 17; 3:6, 8; Titus 1:15, 16. They were
chiefly Jews (1 Tim. 1:7; Titus 1:10, 14; 3:9); but not Jews who
held to simple Phariseeism, like the false teachers among the
Galatians. They more nearly resembled those who troubled the
Colossians&mdash;Jews of a speculative turn of mind, who sought to
bring into Judaism the semi-oriental philosophy of that day. They
were not Gnostics; for Gnosticism was essentially anti-Judaistic,
separating the God of the Jews from the God of Christianity, and
placing the two in antagonism to each other. The speculations of
these false teachers took a direction which was in some respects
akin to the Gnosticism of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page478"
id="page478"></a>{478}</span> the second century; but the
allegation that they were themselves Gnostics rests upon the
misinterpretation of certain passages in these epistles, or
unwarrantable inferences from them.</p>
<p>37. The <i>genuineness</i> of these epistles is sustained by the
unanimous testimony of the ancient church. Only in modern times has
it been called in question by certain writers, who rest their
arguments wholly on alleged internal evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far as their objections are founded on the assumed early date
of the pastoral epistles&mdash;before the close of Paul's
imprisonment at Rome recorded by Luke, on their peculiar tone and
diction, or on the supposed references in them to the Gnosticism of
the second century, they have already been considered. But it is
further alleged:</p>
<p>(1.) That they reveal a <i>hierarchical spirit</i> foreign to
the character of the apostle Paul. The answer is that no trace of
such a spirit is discernible in them. The churches had from the
first their officers&mdash;bishops or elders and deacons; and the
apostle simply gives the necessary directions for the selection of
these, with a few brief hints respecting the line of conduct to be
observed towards them. 1 Tim. 5:1, 17, 19, 22.</p>
<p>(2.) That the <i>institution of widows</i> (1 Tim. 5:9-16)
belongs to a later age. Respecting the exact position of those who
were enrolled in the class of widows there have been different
opinions. One is that this class consisted of those who were to
receive relief from the funds of the church; another, that they
were matrons set apart for special service in the church,
performing for their own sex duties analogous to those which the
presbyters performed for the church generally. The latter opinion
is the more probable of the two, as it explains the conditions
insisted on by the apostle. But according to either view there is
no difficulty in admitting the existence in apostolic times of such
an arrangement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>38. In these pastoral epistles we have the affectionate counsels
of the great apostle to the Gentiles, when he was now ripe in years
and Christian experience and about to close his earthly ministry,
addressed to two young men whom the Holy Ghost had made overseers
of the churches. They are a rich storehouse of instruction for all
to whom God has committed the ministry of reconciliation. Let them,
as they hope at last to render up an account of their stewardship
with joy and not with grief, prayerfully study and reduce to daily
practice these precepts of heavenly wisdom given by the Holy Spirit
through the pen of "Paul the aged."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id=
"page479"></a>{479}</span>
<p>39. <span class="smcap">The first epistle to
Timothy.</span>&mdash;The <i>time</i> of this epistle lies, as we
have seen, beyond the recorded history of the apostle, and before
his second and final imprisonment at Rome, perhaps about A.D. 65 or
66. It was addressed to Timothy at Ephesus not long after the
apostle had left that city to go into Macedonia (chap. 1:3), but
whether from Macedonia or some other province of the Roman empire
cannot be determined. The <i>occasion</i> we learn from the
epistle. Paul had left Timothy in charge of the Ephesian church,
and, being apprehensive of a protracted absence, he sends him these
written instructions relating partly to his own personal demeanor
as a Christian minister, but chiefly to his office as the overseer
of the Ephesian church. In the discharge of this office he is (1)
to withstand and keep down the growing heresies of the day; (2) to
superintend the government of the church in various particulars
which the apostle specifies.</p>
<p>The <i>contents</i> of the epistle though not arranged in
systematic order, are in harmony with its occasion and design. Into
the first chapter, which is of an introductory character, the
apostle, in the free intercourse of confiding affection, inserts a
personal notice of himself, which breathes the spirit of devout
gratitude and deep humility. He then proceeds to give directions
pertaining to the public worship of God&mdash;prayer, the costume
of women, and their place in the public assembly (chap. 2); and to
the choice of bishops and deacons (chap. 3). After a digression in
the fourth chapter respecting the character of the coming apostacy
foretold by the Spirit, which is followed by admonitions to Timothy
of a personal character, he proceeds in the fifth chapter to give
directions respecting the appointment and treatment of elders, of
the elder and younger women, and especially of widows, with
personal counsel to Timothy. Then follows an admonition to
servants, a notice of the false teachers, a warning to the rich
with further counsels to Timothy, and an animating glance at the
second coming of our Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eunice, the mother of Timothy, was a Jewess distinguished for
her piety, as was also his grandmother Lois. Acts 16:1; 2 Tim. 1:5.
By <span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id=
"page480"></a>{480}</span> them he was carefully trained in the
knowledge of the holy Scriptures (2 Tim. 3:15), and had a good
reputation among the brethren when Paul found him at Derbe and
Lystra (Acts 16:1, 2). His father being a Greek, he had never been
subjected to the rite of circumcision. But in consideration of his
mixed descent Paul, to allay the prejudices of his countrymen,
"took and circumcised him," while he would not allow this rite to
be imposed on Titus, who was of unmixed Gentile origin. Timothy was
one of the most trusty and beloved of Paul's fellow-laborers, as we
learn from these and his other epistles, and he naturally desired
the comfort and help of his presence in his final imprisonment at
Rome. 2 Tim. 4:9, 21. His health was feeble (1 Tim. 5:23), and
there are in Paul's epistles some indications that he was naturally
timid and diffident (1 Cor. 16:10, 11; 2 Tim. 1:7, 8; 2:3). But
grace made him faithful to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>40. <span class="smcap">The epistle to Titus</span> which comes
next in chronological order, has a remarkable agreement with the
first to Timothy in both subject-matter and style. With the
exception of what relates to widows and the demeanor of women in
the public assemblies, it contains the same general precepts, with
additional exhortations that young men be sober-minded, and that
the Cretan Christians obey magistrates and be meek and gentle in
their deportment. With these counsels the apostle interweaves, as
in the first epistle to Timothy, exhortations to Titus of a
personal character, and animating notices of God's grace in the
gospel and of the second coming of our Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Respecting the founding of the Cretan churches we have no
information in the Acts of the Apostles. The only time mentioned by
Luke when Paul touched at Crete was on his voyage to Rome as a
prisoner (Acts 27:8); and then he had neither time nor liberty for
the work of preaching the gospel in that island. Crete contained
many Jews, some of whom were present at Jerusalem on the day of
Pentecost (Acts 2:11). The apostle's visit to Crete referred to in
this epistle we assume to have taken place between his first and
second imprisonment at Rome. Whether the churches of the island
were then founded for the first time or had previously existed, it
is certain that Paul left them in an imperfect state of
organization. For this reason he requested Titus to remain, that he
might set in order the things that were wanting, and ordain elders
in every city. Chap. 1:5.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that we have no notice of Titus in the Acts of
the Apostles. From the epistles of Paul we learn that he was his
companion in travel, and intrusted by him at different times with
missions to the churches. He accompanied Paul and Barnabas to the
so-called Council of the Apostles <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page481" id="page481"></a>{481}</span> and Elders at Jerusalem,
where, being a Greek, he was exempted from the necessity of
circumcision. Gal. 2:1, 3. For other notices of him see 2 Cor.
2:13; 7:6, 13, 14; 8:6, 16, 23; 12:18. His stay in Crete was not to
be permanent; for the apostle directs that upon the arrival from
him of Artemas or Tychicus he should rejoin him at
Nicopolis&mdash;probably Nicopolis in Epirus. Chap. 3:12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>41. <span class="smcap">Second Epistle to
Timothy.</span>&mdash;The first epistle to Timothy and that to
Titus are in a certain sense official; that is, they are largely
occupied with apostolic counsels and directions to these two men
respecting the administration of the churches which Paul had
committed to their care. The present epistle is of a more private
and personal character. It was written from Rome when Paul was a
prisoner there (chaps. 1:8, 16, 17; 2:9), and expecting soon to
seal his testimony with his blood (chap. 4:6). In his extremity,
when fidelity to him could be shown only at the hazard of life,
many of his friends had forsaken him. Chaps. 1:15; 4:10. He needed
the presence and help of Timothy, and wrote urging him to come
speedily, and to bring certain articles which he had left at Troas.
Feeling that his end was near, he improved the occasion to give
Timothy his affectionate apostolic counsel and encouragement. Hence
the present epistle differs strikingly in its preceptive part from
the other two. They contain specific directions for ordaining
officers and managing the affairs of the churches; for in them the
apostle writes to men in charge of specific fields of labor. In the
second epistle to Timothy, on the contrary, the apostle's
exhortations are general, for he is summoning him away from his
particular field to give attendance upon himself at Rome. But all
three of the pastoral epistles agree remarkably, as well in their
general style and diction as in their description of existing
errors and false teachers. It is generally thought that Timothy was
at Ephesus; and with this opinion agrees the salutation to "the
household of Onesiphorus," who was at Ephesus. Chap. 4:19 compared
with 1:18. The words of chap. 4:12, however, "Tychicus have I sent
to Ephesus," do not favor this supposition. Hence some have thought
that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id=
"page482"></a>{482}</span> Timothy was not in that city, but only
in its vicinity. The present is undoubtedly the last of Paul's
epistles in the order of time. As such we cannot but peruse it with
solemnity, as the closing testimony of one who has fought the good
fight, finished the appointed course, and kept the faith; and who
here instructs all, especially all preachers of the gospel, how
they may do the same. "And thus we possess an epistle calculated
for all ages of the church; and in which while the maxims cited and
encouragements given apply to all Christians, and especially
ministers of Christ, in their duties and difficulties&mdash;the
affecting circumstances in which the writer himself is placed carry
home to every heart his earnest and impassioned eloquence." Alford,
Introduction to 2 Timothy.</p>
<h3>VIII. EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS.</h3>
<p>42. In regard to the <i>authorship</i> of this epistle biblical
scholars are not agreed. Each of the thirteen preceding epistles
bears the name of Paul. But the present epistle is without either
name or address, and it omits also at the beginning the apostolic
salutation. Thus it commences in the form of an essay, though it
closes in that of an epistle. These circumstances, in connection
with its peculiar style and diction and the peculiar range of the
topics discussed in it, have produced a diversity of opinion on the
question whether Paul was its author, at least its author in the
immediate sense in which he was the author of the preceding
epistles. For the full discussion of the arguments on both sides
the reader must be referred to the commentaries, some of which are
accessible to all. Our limits will only permit us to indicate
certain facts and principles which have a bearing on the authorship
of the epistle and its canonical authority.</p>
<p>The unanimous belief of the <i>Eastern</i> church, where we must
suppose that it was first received and whence the knowledge of it
was spread abroad, ascribed it to Paul as its author either
immediately or virtually; for some, as Origen (in Eusebius' Hist.
Eccl., 6. 14) accounted for its peculiar diction by the supposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id=
"page483"></a>{483}</span> that Paul furnished the thoughts, while
they were reduced to form by the pen of some other person. Another
opinion was that Paul wrote in Hebrew, and that our present
canonical epistle is a translation into Greek (Eusebius' Hist.
Eccl., 3. 38; Clement of Alexandria in Eusebius' Hist. Eccl., 6.
14). In the <i>Western</i> church Clement of Rome did indeed refer
to the epistle as authoritative, but without naming the author. Yet
its Pauline authorship was not generally admitted, nor was it
received as a part of the sacred canon till the fourth century,
when here too the opinion of the Eastern church was adopted. The
Muratorian canon, which represents the belief of the Western church
before the fourth century, omits this epistle. The Syriac Peshito,
on the other hand, inserts it in accordance with its uniform
reception by the Eastern church. This uniformity of belief in the
Eastern church must have had for its starting point the Hebrews to
whom the epistle was sent; and it is a strong argument for the
supposition that it did originally come to them under the sanction
of Paul's name and authority; whether dictated to an amanuensis, as
were most of his epistles, or written with his knowledge and
approbation by some inspired man among his attendants and
fellow-laborers who was thoroughly conversant with his views on the
subjects treated of in the epistle. This is as far as we have any
occasion to go, since we know that the gift of inspiration was not
confined to the circle of the apostles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we cannot affirm that <i>all</i> who were associated with the
apostles in the work of the ministry had the gifts needful for the
composition of writings that should be given to the churches as the
authoritative word of God, so neither can we deny to <i>some</i>
the possession of these gifts, as is plain from the examples of
Mark and Luke. When men who stood in the second grade of relation
to Christ&mdash;<i>apostolic men</i>, as we may conveniently call
them&mdash;composed their works, it is not necessary to assume that
they wrote under a formal apostolic supervision. The "discerning of
spirits" is a gift which we must concede to all of the apostles.
If, then, an associate of one of the apostles had such relations to
him and wrote in such circumstances that we cannot suppose it to
have been done without his knowledge and approbation formal or
implied, we have for his work all needful authority. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id=
"page484"></a>{484}</span> further connection the apostle may have
had with it in the way of suggestion or supervision is a question
which we may well leave undetermined. In judging of this matter we
consider first of all the testimony of the early churches, since
they enjoyed the best means of ascertaining the origin of a
writing; and then the character of the writing itself. Proceeding
in this way we come to the full conviction of <i>the canonical
authority</i> of the epistle to the Hebrews, whether we believe,
with many, that Paul was its immediate author, or, with Origen,
that "the ancients not without reason have handed it down as
Paul's; but on the question who wrote the epistle God only knows
the truth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>43. That the apostle wrote for the instruction of Jewish
Christians is manifest. The uniform tenor of the epistle indicates,
moreover, that they were <i>Jewish Christians</i> without any
admixture of a Gentile element. The salutations at the end further
imply that the epistle addresses not Hebrew Christians in general,
but some particular community of them, which is most naturally to
be sought in Palestine, perhaps in Jerusalem. As to the <i>time</i>
of the epistle, the manner in which it refers to the temple and its
services makes it certain that the author wrote before the
overthrow of Jerusalem, that is, before A.D. 70. The arguments
adduced to show that Paul was its author, either immediately or
virtually, carry it back beyond A.D. 67 or 68, when, according to
ancient tradition, the apostle suffered martyrdom. It was probably
written not many years before that event; but a more exact
determination of the time is impossible. According to the most
probable interpretation of chap. 13:24, the epistle was written
from Italy. But that Timothy was not the bearer of it, as the
subscription states, is plain from the preceding verse, in which he
conditionally promises to come with Timothy at a future time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The references in the epistle to the Levitical priesthood and
the temple services connected with it are in the <i>present</i> or
perfect <i>tenses</i>&mdash;"is ordained," "is encompassed," "he
ought," "taketh this honor," "have a commandment to take tithes"
"receive tithes" "<i>hath given attendance</i> at the altar" (chap.
7:13), "<i>have become</i>" (chap. 7:21, 23), "maketh men high
priests," "who serve," "hath made the first old" (the references in
chap. 9:1-5 are to the ancient tabernacle), "<i>enter</i> always
into the first tabernacle" (chap. 9:6), "which he <i>offers</i>"
(verse 7), "the Holy Ghost this signifying that the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>{485}</span> way into
the holiest places <i>has not yet been made manifest</i>, while the
first tabernacle <i>is as yet standing</i>" (verse 8), "gifts and
sacrifices <i>are offered</i>" (verse 9), "sanctifieth," "are by
the law purged," "can never," "standeth." It is to be regretted
that our version has not in all cases observed this distinction of
tenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>44. The <i>central theme</i> of this book is the superiority of
the Christian over the Mosaic dispensation considered on the side
of its divine Mediator and High-priest. In unfolding this great
theme the writer dwells on the glory and dignity of Christ's person
in contrast with the ancient prophets, with the angels, and with
Moses, all of whom were connected with the first economy. He then
proceeds to exhibit the divine efficacy of Christ's priesthood.
This is the substance, of which the Levitical priesthood, with its
altar, its offerings and all the temple-services connected with it,
was only the shadow. In no book of the New Testament is our Lord's
priestly office set forth with such fullness and rich variety of
illustrations, always with reference to its divinely appointed
type, the Levitical priesthood. This was especially needful to
fortify the Hebrew Christians, who had been educated and lived
under the constant impression of the splendid Mosaic ritual with
its magnificent temple, against the danger of being turned from the
simplicity of the gospel to reliance on the "carnal ordinances" of
Judaism, which would have been virtual apostacy from Christ. This
magnificent epistle constitutes in some sense a solemn requiem to
the old temple service with its altar and priesthood, where the
blood of bulls and goats that can never take away sin had flowed
for so many centuries. This service had accomplished its end in
prefiguring Christ the true "Lamb of God which taketh away the sin
of the world," and it was destined soon to pass away forever "with
tumult, with shouting, with the sound of the trumpet"&mdash;to pass
away forever, that men might give their undivided faith to Christ,
our great High-priest, who ministers for us in the heavenly
tabernacle, presenting there before his Father's throne his own
blood shed on Calvary to make propitiation for the sins of the
world.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id=
"page486"></a>{486}</span>
<p>To the argumentative part of this epistle are appended
exhortations (partly, indeed, anticipated in the preceding part) to
constancy in the Christian profession, drawn from the awful doom
that awaits apostates, from the examples of faith furnished by
ancient worthies, and especially from the example of Christ himself
and the glorious fellowship to which his gospel introduces us. To
these are added some admonitions of a more special character. Thus
the present epistle performs an office in the general system of
revelation which is supplied by no other book of the Old or New
Testament. To the book of Leviticus it may be said to hold the
relation of substance to shadow, and it is its divinely appointed
expositor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES.</h3>
<p>1. Seven epistles, that of James and the six that follow, are
called <i>Catholic</i>, that is, <i>general</i> or
<i>universal</i>, as not being directed to any particular church.
They were not all, however, addressed originally to believers
generally, but some of them to particular classes of believers, or
even to individuals, as the introductory words show.</p>
<h3>I. EPISTLE OF JAMES.</h3>
<p>2. The question respecting the <i>person</i> of James who wrote
this epistle is one of great difficulty. That "James the Lord's
brother," whom Paul names as one of the apostles (Gal. 1:19), is
identical with the James mentioned by Luke in Acts 12:17; 15:13;
21:18, and is the author of the present epistle, is admitted by
most writers, though not by all. That this James of Gal. 1:19 was
the James who is named with Joses, Simon, and Judas, as one of our
Lord's brethren (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3), must be received as
certain. But whether he was identical with "James the son of
Alpheus," who was one of the twelve (Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke
6:15; Acts 1:13), is a question which has been much discussed and
on which eminent biblical scholars are found arrayed on opposite
sides. The question turns very much on the interpretation of the
words "brother," and "brethren" and "sisters," in the passages
above referred to. If we take them in their literal sense, as some
do, then James the son of Alpheus and James the Lord's brother are
different persons. But others understand them in the general sense
of kindred or cousins, believing that our Saviour was the only
child of Mary. A statement at length of the arguments <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>{488}</span> and
objections that are urged on both sides does not come within the
compass of the present work. Nor is it necessary. The author of the
present epistle is beyond all reasonable doubt the James who gave
the final opinion in the assembly of the apostles and elders at
Jerusalem (Acts 15:13-21), whom Paul names with Cephas and John as
one of the "pillars" there (Gal. 2:9), and who elsewhere appears as
a man of commanding influence in the church at Jerusalem (Acts
21:18; Gal. 2:12). If any one doubts his identity with James the
son of Alpheus, who was one of the twelve, this cannot affect the
canonical authority of the epistle. The position of this James in
the church at Jerusalem and his relation to the apostolic college
is such that, even upon the supposition that he did not belong to
the number of the twelve, his writings must have to us the full
weight of apostolic authority. See above chap. 30, No. 42.</p>
<p>3. The <i>place</i> where this epistle was written was
manifestly Jerusalem, where James always resided; and the
<i>persons addressed</i> are "the twelve tribes who are in the
dispersion" (chap. 1:1); that is, as the nature of the case and the
tenor of the epistle make manifest, that part of them who had
embraced Christianity. There is no allusion in the epistle to
Gentile believers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The dispersion</i> is a technical term for the Jews living
out of Palestine among the Gentiles. We need not hesitate to
understand it here literally. The apostle <i>wrote</i> to his
Jewish brethren of the dispersion because he could not visit them
and superintend their affairs as he could those of the Jewish
Christians in and around Jerusalem. Some take the term in a wider
sense of the Jewish Christians scattered abroad in and out of
Palestine, but this is not necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. With regard to the <i>date</i> of this epistle also different
opinions are held. Some place it early in the history of the
church&mdash;earlier, in fact, than any other of the apostolic
epistles&mdash;<i>before</i> the origin of the controversy
respecting circumcision and the Mosaic law recorded in Acts, chap.
15; others quite <i>late</i>, not long before the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans. The latter view best agrees with the
contents of the epistle. The <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page489" id="page489"></a>{489}</span> doctrine of justification
by faith, for which Paul had contended, would naturally be abused
precisely in the way here indicated, by the substitution of a
barren speculative faith, for the true faith that works by love and
purifies the heart and life from sin. The age preceding the
destruction of Jerusalem was one of abounding wickedness,
especially in the form of strife and faction. It had been predicted
by our Lord that the effect of this would be to chill the love of
many of his visible followers and withdraw them from his service.
In truth the descriptions of these unworthy members of the Jewish
Christian community which we find in this epistle, in the second of
Peter, and in that of Jude, are but the realization, in most
particulars, of the state of things foretold in the following
remarkable words of the Saviour: "And then shall many be offended,
and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many
false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many. And because
iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold. But he that
shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." Matt.
24:10-13.</p>
<p>5. For the <i>genuineness</i> and <i>canonical</i> authority of
the present epistle we have a very important testimony in the Old
Syriac version (Peshito), which represents the judgment of the
Eastern churches where the epistle was originally circulated. The
remaining testimonies prior to the fourth century are scanty and
some of them not very decisive. They may be all seen in Davidson's
Introduction to the New Testament, and in the critical commentaries
generally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It cannot be reasonably doubted that the words of Iren&aelig;us,
"Abraham himself, without circumcision and without the observance
of Sabbaths, believed in God, and it was counted to him for
righteousness, and he was called the friend of God" (Against
Heresies, 4.30), refer to James 2:23. Origen quotes the epistle as
"current under the name of James," and intimates that some did not
acknowledge its apostolic authority. But he elsewhere cites it as
that of "James the Lord's brother," "the apostle James," "the
apostle," and simply "James." See in Kirchhofer Quellensamlung, pp.
263, 264. Eusebius reckons the epistle among the books that were
"disputed, but known nevertheless to many." Hist. Eccl., 3, 25.
Elsewhere he says: "It is regarded as spurious; at least not many
of the ancients <span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id=
"page490"></a>{490}</span> have made mention of it." Hist. Eccl.,
2. 23. But these words cannot be regarded as expressing Eusebius'
own opinion; for he himself quotes him as "the holy apostle," and
his words as "Scripture." See in Davidson's Introduction to the New
Testament, vol. 3, p. 336; Kirchhofer Quellensamlung, p. 264.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the course of the fourth century the canonical authority of
this epistle was gradually more and more acknowledged, and in the
fifth its reception in the churches of both the East and the West
became universal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is just what we might expect: a writing little known at
first, obtains a more general circulation, and the knowledge of the
writing and its reception go almost together. The contents entirely
befit the antiquity which the writing claims; no <i>evidence</i>
could be given for rejecting it; it differs in its whole nature
from the foolish and spurious writings put forth in the name of
this James; and thus its gradual reception is to be accounted for
from its having, from early times, been known by some to be genuine
(as shown by the Syraic version), and this knowledge being
afterwards spread more widely." Tregelles in Horne, vol. 4, chap.
25. Davidson suggests that differences of opinion and perplexities
respecting the number of the persons called James in the apostolic
period, and the relation they bore to one another, and also the
fact that the epistle was addressed solely to Jewish Christians,
may have made its early circulation comparatively limited. Perhaps
we may also add, as he does, its apparent contrariety to the
Pauline doctrine of justification by faith, but this is by no means
certain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. This epistle is eminently practical. If any part of it can be
called argumentative, it is that in which the apostle shows that
"faith without works is dead." Chap. 2:14-26. The sins which he
rebukes with such graphic vividness and power were all
pre&euml;minently the sins of his countrymen at that
age&mdash;hearing God's word without doing it, resting in an empty
faith that does not influence the life, inordinate love of worldly
possessions and a self-confident spirit in the pursuit of them,
wanton revelling in worldly pleasures, partiality towards the rich
and contempt of the poor, defrauding the poor of their wages,
ambition to assume the office of teaching, censoriousness, a
lawless and slanderous tongue, bitter envying and strife, mutual
grudging and murmuring, wars and fightings; all these with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id=
"page491"></a>{491}</span> unbelieving and complaining spirit
towards God. But these are not merely Jewish vices. They are deeply
rooted in man's fallen nature, and many a nominal Christian
community of our day may see its own image by looking into the
mirror of this epistle.</p>
<p>The alleged disagreement between Paul and James is unfounded.
Paul's object is to show that the ground of men's justification is
faith in Christ, and not the merit of their good works. The object
of James is to show that faith without good works, like the body
without the spirit, is dead. Paul argues against dead works; James
against dead faith. Here we have no contradiction, but only two
different views of truth that are in entire harmony with each
other, and both of which are essential to true godliness.</p>
<h3>II. EPISTLES OF PETER.</h3>
<p>7. <span class="smcap">The First Epistle of Peter</span> was
unanimously received by the primitive church as the genuine work of
the man whose name it bears. Polycarp, in his epistle to the
Philippians, made numerous citations from it. It was also referred
to by Papias, according to the testimony of Eusebius. Hist. Eccl.
3. 39. Iren&aelig;us, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen,
etc. all quote it expressly. It is found in the Syriac Peshito
version which contains but three of the catholic epistles. It is
wanting in the Muratorian canon, but to this circumstance much
weight cannot be attached when we consider how dark and confused is
the passage referring to the catholic epistles.</p>
<p>8. <i>The readers</i> addressed in the epistle are "the elect
sojourners of the dispersion, of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
and Bithynia," all provinces of Asia Minor. The words
"sojourners"&mdash;or "strangers" as rendered in our English
version&mdash;and "dispersion" are both the appropriate terms for
the Jews living in dispersion. That the apostle, in an introduction
of this kind, should have used the word "sojourners" in a simply
figurative sense, to describe Christians as "pilgrims and strangers
on the earth," is very improbable, especially in immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id=
"page492"></a>{492}</span> connection with the word "dispersion,"
which must be understood literally. We must rather understand the
apostle as recognizing in the Christian churches scattered
throughout the world the true "Israel of God," having for its
framework the believing portion of the covenant people, into which
the Gentile Christians had been introduced through faith, and thus
made the children of Abraham. Compare Rom. 4:12-17; Gal. 3:7-9; and
especially Rom. 11:17-24. Hence it comes to pass that while Peter
addresses them as the ancient people of God, he yet includes
Gentile Christians in his exhortations, as is manifest from various
passages, especially from chap. 4:3.</p>
<p>9. According to chap. 5:13 the <i>place</i> from which this
epistle was written was Babylon. No valid reason exists why we
should not understand here the literal Babylon. The old opinion
that the apostle used the word enigmatically to signify Rome is
nothing more than a conjecture in itself improbable. It has been
urged not without reason that Peter names the provinces of Asia
Minor in the order which would be natural to one writing from
Babylon; naming Pontus first, which lay nearest to Babylon, and
Asia and Bithynia, which were the most remote, last. The question
of the <i>date</i> of this epistle is connected with that of its
<i>occasion</i>. This seems to have been a "fiery trial" of
persecution that had already begun to come upon the Christians of
the provinces named in the introductory address. Chaps. 1:6, 7;
2:12, 19, 20; 3:14, 16, 17; 4:1, 12-19; 5:9, 10. The exact date and
character of this persecution cannot be determined. The majority of
commentators assign it to the latter years of Nero's reign, which
ended A.D. 68. The second epistle of Peter was written not long
before the apostle's death, and after the epistles of Paul had
become generally known in Asia Minor. As we cannot reasonably
separate the two epistles by a great space of time (see below, No.
11), we infer that the first was written after Paul's first
imprisonment in Rome, say somewhere between A.D. 63 and 67.</p>
<p>10. The general tone of the first epistle is in harmony with its
occasion. The apostle seeks to animate and strengthen his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id=
"page493"></a>{493}</span> brethren in view of the "fiery trial" of
persecution that had already begun to come upon them. To this end
he sets before them in glowing language the greatness and glory of
the heavenly inheritance in reserve for them, which was purchased
by the precious blood of Christ, and the dignity and blessedness of
suffering for Christ's sake, with the assurance of God's faithful
presence and protection. With these encouragements he intermingles
admonitions suited to their circumstances. He exhorts them as
strangers and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts and all the
other vices of their former life in ignorance; to commend their
religion by a holy deportment which shall put to shame the
calumnies of their adversaries; to perform faithfully all the
duties of their several stations in life; to be humble, sober,
vigilant, and ready always to give a reason of their Christian
hope; and above all things to have fervent charity among
themselves. The fervent spirit of the great apostle of the
circumcision, chastened and mellowed by age, shines forth
conspicuously in this epistle. The closing chapter, where he
addresses first the elders, then the younger, then the whole body
of believers, charms the reader by the holy tranquillity which
pervades it throughout&mdash;a tranquillity deeply grounded in that
faith which is "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen."</p>
<p>11. <span class="smcap">The second epistle of Peter.</span> The
<i>address</i> of this epistle is general (chap. 1:1); yet the
reference which it contains to the first (chap. 3:1) shows that the
apostle had in mind primarily the same circle of churches. The
character of this reference&mdash;"This second epistle, beloved, I
now write unto you, in which [two epistles] I stir up your pure
minds by way of reminding [you]"&mdash;indicates that the second
was not separated from the first by a very great space of
<i>time</i>, certainly not many years. The apostle wrote with the
conviction that his decease was near at hand (chap. 1:13-15). There
is a tradition, the correctness of which, however, is doubted by
many, that he suffered martyrdom at Rome under the persecution
raised by Nero against the Christians. This would be about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id=
"page494"></a>{494}</span> A.D. 67. As to the <i>place</i> from
which the epistle was written we have no information.</p>
<p>12. The present epistle is one of the <i>disputed</i> books.
Chap. 5, No. 7, and Chap. 6. The question respecting its
genuineness may be conveniently considered under the two heads of
<i>external</i> and <i>internal</i> evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>external</i> testimony to the present epistle is scanty.
Passing by some doubtful references we come first to Origen who
says (in Eusebius, Hist. Eccl., 6. 25): "But Peter, upon whom is
built the church of Christ, against which the gates of hell shall
not prevail, has left one acknowledged epistle; a second also, if
you will, for it is doubted of." In those of his works which are
extant only in the Latin version of Rufinus, Origen in a number of
passages quotes the present epistle as Scripture. It has been
suspected that these passages were interpolated by Rufinus, who
took many liberties with the text of Origen; but one of them, which
occurs at the beginning of his seventh homily on Joshua, is so
peculiar that we cannot well doubt that Origen himself was its
author. In allusion to the procession of priests blowing with
trumpets when the Israelites compassed the walls of Jericho (Josh.
chap. 6), he compares the writers of the New Testament to so many
sacerdotal trumpeters, assigning to them trumpets for each book,
and mentioning <i>every book</i>, as well the disputed as the
acknowledged: "First Matthew in his gospel, gave a blast with his
sacerdotal trumpet. Mark also, Luke, and John, sounded with their
single sacerdotal trumpets. Peter also sounds aloud with the two
trumpets of his epistles; James also, and Jude. But John adds yet
again to blow with the trumpet through his epistles and Apocalypse;
Luke, also, narrating the Acts of the Apostles. But last of all
that man came, who said: 'I think that God has set forth us
apostles last,' and thundering with the fourteen trumpets of his
epistles, overthrew to their foundations the walls of Jericho, and
all the engines of idolatry and dogmas of philosophers." The
"epistles" through which the apostle John sounds are obviously his
three epistles. The "fourteen trumpets" upon which Paul blows
include the epistle to the Hebrews. In this remarkable passage,
then, we have an <i>exhaustive list</i> of our present canonical
books; and there is no ground for imputing any interpolation to the
translator. It may be said, indeed, that this enumeration of the
books of the New Testament is made in a popular way, and does not
imply Origen's deliberate judgment that they were all of apostolic
authority. If this be granted, it still remains evident from the
form of the passage that <i>all the books of our present canon were
in current ecclesiastical use</i> in Origen's day, whatever doubts
he may have had respecting some of them, and that they constituted,
along with the writings of the Old Testament, that whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page495" id=
"page495"></a>{495}</span> of divine revelation which the Christian
churches employed in assaulting the kingdom of Satan.</p>
<p>The testimony of Eusebius himself is of the same general import
as that of Origen&mdash;that the first epistle of Peter has been
universally acknowledged; but that the one current as the second
has not been received as a part of the New Testament; but yet,
appearing useful to many, has been studied with the other
Scriptures (Hist. Eccl., 3. 3); that among the writings which are
disputed, yet known to many, are the epistles current as those of
James and Jude, and the second epistle of Peter (Hist. Eccl., 3.
25).</p>
<p>Jerome says that Peter "wrote two epistles that are called
catholic, of which the second is denied by most persons on account
of its disagreement in style with the first." Scrip. Eccl., 1. But
he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in
style and character and structure of words by the assumption that
Peter used <i>different interpreters</i> in the composition of the
two epistles (Epist. 120 ad Hedib., chap. 11); and from his time
onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New
Testament.</p>
<p>The reader who wishes to investigate farther the question of
external testimonies will find them all given in Davidson's
Introduct. to New Test.; and Alford's Commentary, Introduction to 2
Peter. We simply repeat the remark already made (Chap. 6, No. 3)
that although the universal and undisputed reception of a book by
all the early churches cannot be explained except on the assumption
of its genuineness, its non-reception by some is no conclusive
argument against it. It may have remained (as seems to have been
peculiarly the case with some of the catholic epistles) for a
considerable period in obscurity. When it began to be more
extensively known, the general reception and use of it would be a
slow process both from the difficulty of communication in ancient
as compared with modern times, and especially from the slowness and
hesitancy with which the churches of one region received anything
new that came from another region. Chap. 2, No. 5. Jerome does
indeed mention the objection from the difference of style between
this epistle and the first of Peter; but it is doubtful whether in
this matter he speaks for the early churches generally. The
obscurity in which the epistle had remained, partly at least
because it was not addressed to the guardianship of any particular
church, seems to have been the chief ground of doubt.</p>
<p>The <i>internal</i> testimony for and against the genuineness of
this epistle has been discussed at great length by many writers.
The reader will find good summaries of them in the two works above
referred to, also in the critical commentaries generally and the
modern Bible dictionaries. If one would come to true results in
this field of investigation it is important that he begin with true
principles. There are what may be called <i>staple
peculiarities</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id=
"page496"></a>{496}</span> which mark the style of one writer as
compared with that of another&mdash;that of John, for example, in
contrast with that of Paul. We cannot conceive of these as being
wanting. But then we must allow to one and the same writer a
considerable range of variation in style and diction, dependent
partly on difference of subject matter, and partly on varying
frames of mind of which no definite account can be given. If one
would be convinced of this, he has only to read side by side the
epistle of Paul to the Romans and his second to the Corinthians.
Reserving now the second chapter of the present epistle for
separate consideration, we do not find in the two remaining
chapters, as compared with the first epistle, any such fundamental
differences of style and diction as can constitute a just ground
for denying the common authorship of the two epistles. For the
particulars, as well as for the examination of other objections of
an internal character, the reader must be referred to the sources
above named. It is certainly remarkable that Peter should refer to
the writings of Paul in such terms as to class them with the
"Scriptures" of the Old Testament. Chap. 3:16. But, as Alford
remarks, this implies not that the canon of the New Testament had
been settled when the present epistle was written, but only that
"there were certain writings by Christian teachers, which were
reckoned on a level with the Old Testament Scriptures, and called
by the same name. And that that was not the case, even in the
traditional lifetime of Peter, it would be surely unreasonable to
deny." We close this part of the discussion with the following
words from the same author: "Our general conclusion from all that
has preceded must be in favor of the genuineness and canonicity of
this second epistle; acknowledging at the same time, that the
subject is not without considerable difficulty. That difficulty
however is lightened for us by observing that on the one hand, it
is common to this epistle with some others of those called
catholic, and several of the later writings of the New Testament;
and on the other, that no difference can be imagined more markedly
distinctive, than that which separates all those writings from even
the earliest and best of the post-apostolic period. Our epistle is
one of those latter fruits of the great outpouring of the Spirit on
the apostles, which, not being intrusted to the custody of any one
church or individual, required some considerable time to become
generally known; which when known, were suspected, bearing, as they
necessarily did traces of their late origin, and notes of polemical
argument; but of which as apostolic and inspired writings, there
never was, when once they became known, any general doubt; and
which, as the sacred canon became fixed, acquired, and have since
maintained, their due and providential place among the books of the
New Testament."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13. The <i>object</i> of the present epistle is to warn
believers against being led away with the error of the wicked so as
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id=
"page497"></a>{497}</span> fall from their own steadfastness. Chap.
3:17. It contains accordingly extended notices of the gross errors
in doctrine and morals which, as we know from the New Testament,
abounded in the Christian church near the close of the apostolic
period. The second chapter, which is occupied with a vivid
description of the false teachers that had "crept in unawares"
(chap. 2:1; Jude 4), is very peculiar in its contents; and its
agreement with the epistle of Jude is of such a character as leads
to the inference that the two writings are somehow connected with
each other. It has been supposed that both writers drew from a
common source unknown to us. More probable is the opinion that one
of them had in view the words of the other. A comparison of the two
writings will perhaps lead to the belief that Jude's was the
original, though on this point biblical scholars differ. It matters
not to us whether, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, Peter
employed, in a free and independent way, the words of Jude, or Jude
those of Peter. Upon either supposition his writing is as much
inspired as if he had written independently. The most prominent
idea of Peter's first epistle is patience and steadfastness in the
endurance of suffering for Christ's sake; that of this second
epistle is caution against the seductions of false teachers. Thus
each epistle fills an important place in the entire economy of
revelation.</p>
<h3>III. EPISTLES OF JOHN.</h3>
<p>14. <span class="smcap">The first epistle of John</span> bears
throughout the impress of its <i>authorship</i>. That it was
written by the same man who wrote the fourth gospel is too evident
to be reasonably controverted. On this ground alone its genuineness
and authenticity may be regarded as established on a firm basis.
But the external testimonies to its authorship are also abundant
from Polycarp, the disciple of the apostle, and onward. It is
unnecessary to enumerate them. In respect to the <i>date</i> of
this epistle we have no certain knowledge. The common opinion is
that it was written after the gospel, and towards the close of the
first century. With this supposition the contents agree. It
contains <span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id=
"page498"></a>{498}</span> the affectionate counsel of an aged
apostle to his younger brethren, whom he addresses as his "little
children." He writes, moreover, in "the last time," when, according
to the prediction of our Lord and his apostles, many antichrists
and false prophets are abroad in the world (chaps. 2:18; 4:1-3),
and there are some who deny that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
(chap. 4:2, 3). As to the <i>place</i> of the apostle's writing, if
we follow ancient tradition, which makes Ephesus his home in his
old age, we may well believe that he wrote from that city, and that
the epistle was addressed primarily to the circle of churches which
had Ephesus for a centre.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the ancients refer to the present epistle as written to
the <i>Parthians</i>. But this is a very improbable assumption, and
rests apparently on some mistake. The apostle evidently writes to
those who are under his spiritual care; and these are not the
Parthians, but the Christians of Asia, to whom also the seven
letters of the Apocalypse are addressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>15. The epistle has unity throughout, but not the unity of
systematic logical arrangement. Its unity consists rather in the
fact that all its thoughts revolve around one great central truth,
<i>the incarnation of the Son of God in the person of Jesus Christ
for the salvation of the world</i>. With this truth he begins, and
he affirms it authoritatively, as one of the primitive apostolic
witnesses: "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you."
Chaps. 1:3; 4:6. He guards it also against perversion, when he
insists upon the reality of our Lord's incarnation: "Every spirit
that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God:
and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh, is not of God" (chap. 4:2, 3), words which are with good
reason understood as referring to a very ancient form of error,
that of the <i>Docet[oe]</i>, who maintained that the Son of God
had not a real, but only an apparent body. The reception through
faith of this great truth, that the Son of God has come in the
flesh for man's salvation, brings us into blissful union and
communion with the Father and the Son, and thus into the possession
of sonship and eternal life. Chaps. 1:3; 3:1, 2; 4:15; 5:1, 13, 20.
The rejection <span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id=
"page499"></a>{499}</span> of this truth is the rejection of God's
own testimony concerning his Son (chaps. 2:22; 5:9, 10), and thus
the rejection of eternal life; for out of Christ, the Son of God,
there is no life (chap. 5:11, 12). But this reception of Christ is
not a matter of mere theoretic belief. It is a practical coming to
the Father and the Son, and a holy union with them. The proof of
such union with God and Christ is likeness to God and obedience to
God's commandments. They who profess to know God and to be in him,
while they walk in darkness and allow themselves in sin, are liars
and the truth is not in them. Chaps. 1:5-7; 2:4-6; 3:5-10, 24; 5:4,
5, 18. The sum of all God's attributes is love; and the sum of
Christian character is love also. Chap. 4:16. But there can be no
true love towards God where there is none towards the brethren; and
such love must manifest itself "not in word, neither in tongue; but
in deed and in truth." Chaps. 3:11-18; 4:7-11, 20, 21; 5:1. He that
loves his brother abides in the light; but he that hates him abides
in darkness and death. Chaps. 2:9-11; 3:14, 15. All believers have
an abiding unction of the Spirit, which enables them to distinguish
between truth and falsehood, and keeps them from the seductions of
the many antichrists that are abroad. Chap. 2:18-27. Such true
believers, whose hearts are filled with love, are raised above
fear, and have confidence in prayer, and may look forward with
joyful confidence to the day of judgment. Chaps. 2:28; 3:18-20;
4:17, 18; 5:14, 15. These fundamental truths the apostle reiterates
in various forms and connections, intermingling with them various
admonitions and promises of a more particular character. He dwells
with especial fulness on the evidences of discipleship as
manifested in the daily spirit and life. There is perhaps no part
of God's word so directly available to the anxious inquirer who
wishes to know what true religion is, and whether he possesses it.
He who, in humble reliance on the illumination of the divine
Spirit, applies to himself this touchstone of Christian character,
will know whether he is of God, or of the world that lies in
wickedness.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id=
"page500"></a>{500}</span>
<p>16. <span class="smcap">Second and third epistles of
John.</span> These two short epistles are so closely related to
each other in style and manner that they have always been regarded
as written by one and the same person. In considering, therefore,
the question of their authorship we take them both together. Though
reckoned by Origen (in Eusebius' Hist. Eccl., 6. 25) and by
Eusebius himself (Hist. Eccl., 3. 25; Demonstratio Evangel. 3. 5)
among the disputed writings, the external testimony to their
apostolic authorship is upon the whole satisfactory, embracing the
names of Iren&aelig;us, Clement of Alexandria, Dionysius of
Alexandria, Jerome, etc. When we take into account the small extent
of these epistles it is plain that no unfavorable inference can be
drawn from the silence of Tertullian and others. Nor is there any
internal evidence against them. That the man who, in his gospel,
studiously avoids the mention of his own name, describing himself
as "the disciple whom Jesus loved," and, in his first epistle,
simply classes himself with the other apostles&mdash;"that which
<i>we</i> have seen and heard," etc.&mdash;should in these
epistles, where some designation of himself was necessary, speak of
himself as "the elder" is not surprising. Compare 1 Peter 5:1.</p>
<p>17. Concerning the date of these two epistles we know nothing.
The object of the first seems to have been to set before the lady
to whom it was addressed the importance of a discriminating love,
which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, and does not allow
itself to aid and abet error by misplaced kindness towards its
teachers.</p>
<p>In the second the apostle, writing to Gaius, commends to his
hospitality, certain missionary brethren, who were strangers in the
place where this disciple lived. It would seem that the design of
these brethren was to preach the gospel to the Gentiles without
charge; that he had in a former letter, commended them to the
church where Gaius resided; but that Diotrephes had hindered their
reception, and persecuted those who favored them.</p>
<p>Short as these epistles are, then, each of them contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id=
"page501"></a>{501}</span> weighty instruction&mdash;the first, in
reference to ill-timed kindness and liberality towards the teachers
of error; the second, concerning the character and conduct of those
who love to have the preeminence, and the abhorrence in which they
ought to be held by all who love the purity and peace of the
churches.</p>
<h3>IV. EPISTLE OF JUDE.</h3>
<p>18. The writer of this epistle styles himself "the servant of
Jesus Christ, and brother of James." Chap. 1:1. This James is
undoubtedly the same man who held so conspicuous a place in the
church at Jerusalem, and was the author of the epistle which bears
his name. Whether Jude was an apostle, or an apostolic man, like
Mark and Luke, depends upon the question respecting the relation
which his brother James held to Christ, concerning which see the
introduction to the epistle of James. In either case the canonical
authority of the epistle holds good. The close relation between
this epistle and the second chapter of Peter's second epistle has
already been noticed. See above, No. 13. It was probably anterior
in time to that epistle, but not separated from it by a great
number of years. If we may infer anything from the abundant use
made by the writer of Jewish history and tradition, the persons
addressed are Jewish Christians.</p>
<p>19. Eusebius classes this epistle also among the disputed
writings (Hist. Eccl., 2. 23; 3. 25), yet the testimonies to its
genuineness are ample&mdash;the Muratorian canon, Tertullian,
Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Jerome, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was objected to this epistle in ancient times that the writer
quotes from the apocryphal book of Enoch (verses 14, 15). To this
it may be answered&mdash;(1) that, if this be the case, Jude does
not sanction the book of Enoch as a whole, but only this particular
tradition embodied in it; (2) that the writer of the book of Enoch
manifestly made use of a current tradition, and that, for anything
that appears to the contrary, Jude may have availed himself of the
same tradition, independently of the book of Enoch. That an
inspired writer should refer to a traditional history not recorded
in the Old Testament ought not to give offence. The apostle Paul
does the same (2 Tim. 3:8, 9); and Jude himself in another passage
(verse 9).</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id=
"page502"></a>{502}</span>
<p>20. The <i>design</i> of the epistle Jude himself gives in
explicit terms (verses 3, 4). It is to guard believers against the
seductions of false teachers, corrupt in practice as well as
doctrine; whose selfishness, sensuality, and avarice; whose
vain-glorious, abusive, and schismatic spirit, he describes in
vivid language, denouncing upon them at the same time the awful
judgment of God. The apostolic portraiture has not yet become
antiquated in the history of Christ's church.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id=

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>THE APOCALYPSE.</h3>
<p>1. The word <i>Apocalypse</i> (Greek <i>Apokalupsis</i>)
signifies <i>Revelation</i>, the title given to the book in our
English version as well from its opening word as from its contents.
Of all the writings of the New Testament that are classed by
Eusebius among the disputed books (<i>Antilegomena</i>, chap. 5.
6), the apostolic authorship of this is sustained by the greatest
amount of <i>external</i> evidence; so much so that Eusebius
acknowledges it as doubtful whether it should be classed among the
<i>acknowledged</i> or the <i>disputed</i> books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was known to Papias, to Melito bishop of Sardis, and to
Theophilus of Antioch; is quoted as a part of Scripture by the
churches of Vienne and Lyons in the last quarter of the second
century; and is expressly ascribed to the apostle John by Justin
Martyr, Iren&aelig;us, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, the
Muratorian canon, Hippolytus, Origen, Jerome, etc. The testimonies
may be seen in Davidson's Introduction to the New Test., in Alford,
and in the other works already frequently referred to. Eusebius,
after giving a list of the <i>acknowledged</i> books, adds: "After
these should be placed, if it be thought proper, the Revelation of
John, concerning which we shall give the opinions at the proper
time." Then, at the end of a list of the <i>disputed</i> and
<i>rejected</i> books he adds: "And moreover, as I said, the
Revelation of John, if it be thought proper, which some, as I said,
reject, but others reckon among the acknowledged books" (Hist.
Eccl., 3. 25); and again, after mentioning with approbation the
account of those who said that there were at Ephesus two who bore
the name of John (John the <i>apostle</i>, and the so-called
<i>presbyter</i> John), he adds: "For it is probable that the
second, if any one be not willing to allow that it was the first,
saw the Revelation current under the name of John" (Hist. Eccl., 3.
39). Those who denied the apostolic authorship of the book
generally referred it to this latter, John the presbyter. So
Dionysius of Alexandria and others. But for this they adduced no
historic proof. Their arguments were drawn wholly from
considerations relating to its internal character, especially in
the case of some, its supposed millenarian views. Upon any fair
principle of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id=
"page504"></a>{504}</span> judging, we must concede that the
apostolic authorship of this book is sustained by a mass of ancient
testimony not rebutted by any contrary testimony which rests on a
historic basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. In modern, as in ancient times, the main arguments against
the apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse have been drawn from its
<i>internal</i> character, especially as contrasted with that of
the fourth gospel and the first epistle of John. On this ground the
assaults upon the book have been many and strong, and they have
been met with vigorous resistance. To review the arguments on both
sides would exceed our limits. Many of them, moreover, presuppose a
knowledge of the original languages of both the Old and the New
Testament. We can only indicate some considerations of a general
nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1.) No valid argument against the apostolic authorship of this
book can be drawn from the fact that the writer specifies his name
in the introduction and elsewhere. Chaps. 1:1, 4, 9; 21:2; 22:8. It
may surprise us that the man who studiously avoids mentioning his
name in the fourth gospel, and who describes himself in his second
and third epistles as "the elder," should here directly introduce
his name at the beginning and in the progress of the book. But for
this difference he may have had a good reason, whether we can
discover it or not. The direct command, addressed to him
personally, that he should write down his visions and send them to
the seven churches of Asia would seem to imply the propriety, if
not the necessity, of his connecting his own name with the record
of them. He addressed the churches immediately and authoritatively
in the name of the risen and glorified Saviour. What more natural
and proper than that he should inform them directly who he was that
had received this heavenly message.</p>
<p>(2.) The <i>doctrinal</i> views of the Apocalypse afford no
argument against its apostolic authorship. The writer, it is true,
moves to a great extent in a new and peculiar sphere of truth; but
there is nothing in it contradictory to the teachings of John's
gospel and epistles. On the contrary, the great central truths that
relate to Christ's person and office are in perfect harmony with
those teachings.</p>
<p>(3.) The <i>spirit</i> of the Apocalypse is not contradictory to
that of the gospel and epistles. A writer in Alexander's Kitto
says: "Quiet contemplation has full scope in the evangelist;
mildness and love find utterance in affectionate discourse. But the
spirit of the apocalyptist is stern and revengeful, with cutting
reproofs, calls to repentance, commands and threatenings." The
answer to all this is that, just as the human body has bones and
muscles as well as fluids and soft tissues, so the mediatorial
government <span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id=
"page505"></a>{505}</span> of Christ has a stern as well as a mild
side; and that the very nature of the visions contained in the
apocalypse gives prominence to this side.</p>
<p>(4.) The main objections are based on <i>diversity of style and
diction</i>. Notwithstanding all the true points of resemblance in
this respect that have been adduced by various writers, the
difference between the Apocalypse, on the one hand, and the gospel
and epistles of John, on the other, is very striking. But here we
must take into account, first of all, the great difference in the
<i>subject-matter</i>, which naturally brings a corresponding
difference of language. Next, the difference in the <i>mode of
divine communication</i>. The gospel and epistles were written
under that constant tranquil illumination of the Holy Spirit which
all the apostles enjoyed. The subject-matter of the Apocalypse was
given in direct vision&mdash;much of it, moreover, through the
medium of oral address. To one who believes in the reality of the
revelations here recorded it is vain that an opponent urge the
difference in style between the first epistle of John and the
epistles to the seven churches of Asia; since these latter are
expressed in the very words of Christ. Inseparably connected with
the peculiar mode of revelation in the Apocalypse are the peculiar
<i>mental state and circumstances</i> in which the apostle wrote.
He composed the gospel and epistles in the calmness of tranquil
contemplation and reminiscences of the past. The visions of the
Apocalypse he received "in the Spirit" (chap. 1:10; 4:2); that is,
in a state of ecstacy; and, according to the plain language of the
book, he <i>wrote them down at the time</i>, beginning, as we must
suppose, with the second chapter, the introductory chapter and some
closing remarks having been added afterwards. The direction: "What
thou seest write in a book" (chap. 1:11, 19), does not indeed imply
that he should write upon the spot; but that he did so is plainly
indicated elsewhere: "When the seven thunders had uttered their
voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven
saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders
uttered, and write them not" (chap. 10:4). In entire harmony with
this is another passage: "And I heard a voice from heaven saying
unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from
henceforth," etc. (chap. 14:13); that is, "Write down now these
words of comfort." The apostle, therefore, wrote down his visions
one after another immediately after they were received. When he
wrote he was not in a state of unconsciousness, but of mental and
spiritual exaltation above his ordinary condition. To affirm that
he could not have received this series of visions without being
deprived of the capacity to record them at the time, would be to
limit the modes of divine revelation by our ignorance. If we cannot
understand how the apostle could hear "in the Spirit" the voices of
the seven thunders, and immediately prepare to write down their
utterances, we ought, at least, reverently to receive the fact as
stated by him. To expect from one writing in such circumstances
careful attention to the rules <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page506" id="page506"></a>{506}</span> of Greek syntax and the
idioms of the Greek language would be absurd. Undoubtedly Plato in
a like situation would have written pure Attic Greek, because that
would have been to him the most natural mode of writing. But the
Galilean fisherman, a Jew by birth and education, fell back upon
the Hebrew idioms with which he was so familiar. Finally we must
remember that, after the analogy of the Old Testament prophecies,
this prophetic book is expressed in <i>poetic diction</i>. It is
full of images borrowed from the old Hebrew prophets, often
spiritualized and applied in a higher sense. Looking to the imagery
alone, one may well call this book a <i>grand anthology</i> of the
old Hebrew poets. But the poetic diction of one and the same writer
may differ widely from his prose style, as we see in the case of
Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.</p>
<p>If the above considerations do not wholly remove the difficulty
under consideration they greatly relieve it. The apostolic
authorship of the fourth gospel and the first epistle of John is
sustained by a mass of evidence that cannot be set aside. That the
same John also wrote the visions of the Apocalypse is attested, as
we have seen, by the almost unanimous voice of antiquity. Far
greater difficulties are involved in the denial of the ancient
tradition of the church than in the admission of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. The <i>date</i> of the Apocalypse has been a matter of much
discussion, the great question being whether it was written before
or after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. The external
testimony strongly preponderates on the side of a late date; for
the great body of this tradition represents the banishment of the
apostle to the isle of Patmos as having taken place under Domitian
who succeeded Titus, and reigned from A.D. 81 to 96. This
supposition also agrees with the fact that the recipients of our
Lord's seven messages (chaps. 2, 3) are the seven churches of
Proconsular Asia, among whom, according to the unanimous testimony
of the primitive church, the apostle spent the latter years of his
life. The hypothesis of an earlier date is but feebly supported by
external testimony. It rests mainly on the alleged reference of the
writer to the overthrow of Jerusalem as an event yet future, and as
being the main subject of the prophesies contained in the book. But
this reference has never been clearly established, and is
contradicted by the general analogy of prophecy, by the contents of
the book, and by its manifest relation to the prophecies of Daniel.
A <span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id=
"page507"></a>{507}</span> few only of the briefer prophetic books,
as those of Jonah and Nahum, confine themselves to one particular
event lying in the near future. All the more extended among them,
and many of the shorter, look forward undeniably to the distant
future. The book of Daniel can be interpreted only as containing a
great scheme of prophecy stretching forward into the distant
future, and with this the revelation of John has the closest
connection. The <i>place</i> where the revelation was received was
the isle of Patmos, one of the group called Sporades in the
&AElig;gean sea off the southwestern corner of Asia Minor, where
the apostle represents himself to have been "for the word of God,
and for the testimony of Jesus Christ" (chap. 1:9): that is, in
accordance with ancient tradition, banished to that isle on account
of the gospel.</p>
<p>4. For the <i>interpretation</i> of this book many and very
discordant plans have been proposed. Setting aside at the outset
all those schemes which do not find in the Apocalypse a view of the
conflicts of Christ's people to the end of time and their final
victory over their enemies, there remain two general principles of
interpretation. The first may be called the <i>generic</i>
principle. Those who adopt it inquire only after the general import
of the symbols employed, without attempting any particular
application of them to the history of the church in connection with
that of the world. Thus, the white horse of the first seal (chap.
6:2) denotes in general the conquests of Christ through his gospel;
the red horse of the second seal (chap 6:4), war and carnage, as
accompanying the progress of the truth; and so on throughout the
other symbols of the book. But when we come to the most important
part of the prophecies, those concerning the two beasts (chap. 13),
and that concerning the woman riding on the scarlet-colored beast
(chap. 17), this principle utterly fails. It cannot be that so many
specific and very peculiar marks mean only persecuting powers in
general. They point with wonderful clearness and precision to that
grand combination of the civil with the ecclesiastical power of
which papal Rome has ever been the chief representative.</p>
<p>We come, then, for the true key to the Apocalypse, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id=
"page508"></a>{508}</span> other principle, which may be called the
<i>historic</i>. This seeks in the history of the church and of the
world for the great events foretold in this book. It is no valid
objection to this principle, that in the attempt to apply it
interpreters find great, and in many cases insuperable
difficulties. The mystery of God is not yet finished. It may be
that the mighty events of the future can alone throw a clear light
on the entire plan of the book. Meanwhile we must wait in
reverential expectation, having in the plain fulfilment of that
part of its prophecies which describes the rise and character of
the combined ecclesiastical and political power which, under the
name of Christianity, persecutes the true servants of Christ, a
certain pledge that all the rest will be accomplished in due
season. Expositors are agreed that the predictions of the book do
not run on in chronological order from beginning to end. Most find
in chaps. 6:1-11:18 (with an episode, chaps. 10:1-11:13) one series
relating more to the outward history of the world in its relations
to God's people; while in chap. 12 the writer returns to the
primitive days of Christianity, and gives a more interior and
spiritual view of the conflicts of God's people along the track of
ages and their final triumph, adding at the close various
supplementary views of the same mighty struggle and victory.</p>
<p>5. On the <i>symbolic import of the numbers</i> in the
Apocalypse a few words may be added.</p>
<p><i>Seven</i> is the well known symbol of completeness, and this
is the most prominent number in the book. Thus we have the seven
churches of Asia represented by the seven golden candlesticks, and
their seven angels represented by seven stars (chap. 1:4, 12, 16,
20); the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are
the seven spirits of God (chap. 4:5); the seven seals (chap. 5:1);
the seven trumpets (chap. 8:2); the seven thunders (chap. 10:4);
the seven last plagues (chap. 15:1); to which may be added the
seven ascriptions of praise&mdash;power, riches, wisdom, strength,
honor, glory, blessing (chap. 5:12), blessing, glory, wisdom,
thanksgiving, honor, power, might (chap. 7:12). Lastly, we have the
seven heads of the persecuting beast in all <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>{509}</span> its
various forms. Chaps. 12:3; 13:1; 17:3. So far as the number seven
has its fulfilment in the history of the world, we are at liberty
to suppose that this is accomplished, in part at least, by the
manner in which the wisdom of God has been pleased to group
together the events of prophecy&mdash;a grouping which is always
appropriate, but might have been different had the plan of
representation so required. The final judgments which precede the
millennium, for example, which in chaps. 15 and 16 are set forth
under the figure of seven vials full of the wrath of God, might
have been, by another mode of distribution, represented under the
number two. Many think they are thus represented in chap. 14:14-20.
Another prophetic number, occurring in Daniel and the Apocalypse,
always as a designation of time, is the <i>half of seven</i>. Thus
we have "a time, and times, and half a time," that is, three years
and a half (chap. 12:14); or in months, "forty and two months"
(chaps. 11:2; 13:5); or in days, "a thousand two hundred and
threescore days" (chaps. 11:3; 12:6). Compare Daniel 7:25. Again,
answering to these three years and a half, we have the three days
and a half during which the two witnesses lie dead. Chap. 11:9, 11.
The number <i>six</i>, moreover, from its peculiar relation to
seven, represents the preparation for the consummation of God's
plans. Hence the sixth seal (chap. 6:12-17), the sixth trumpet
(chap. 9:14-21), and the sixth vial (chap. 16:12-16) are each
pre&euml;minent in the series to which they belong. They usher in
the awful judgments of Heaven which destroy the wicked. Here,
perhaps, we have the key to the symbolic import of the number of
the beast, 666. While it represents, according to the principles of
Greek numeration, the number of a man, it seems to indicate that
upon him fall all the judgments of the sixth seal, the sixth
trumpet, and the sixth vial.</p>
<p><i>Four</i> is the natural symbol for universality. Thus we have
the four living creatures round about the throne (chap. 4:6),
perhaps as symbols of the agencies by which God administers his
universal providential government (chaps. 6:1, 3, 5, 7; 15:7); the
four angels standing on the four corners of the earth <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>{510}</span> and
holding the four winds (chap. 7:1); and the four angels bound in
the river Euphrates (chap. 9:14). So also in the fourfold
enumeration, "kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation," or its
equivalent. Chaps. 5:9; 10:11; 11:9; 14:6; 17:15. <i>A third and a
fourth part</i>, on the contrary, represent what is partial. Chaps.
6:8; 8:12; 9:18.</p>
<p><i>Twelve</i> is the well-known signature of God's people.
Compare the twelve tribes of the Old Testament and the twelve
apostles of the New; the woman with a crown of twelve stars (chap.
12:1); the twelve gates, twelve angels, twelve foundations of the
New Jerusalem, the twelve times twelve cubits of its wall, and its
tree of life that yields twelve harvests a year (chaps. 21:12, 14;
22:2). We have also the same number combined with a thousand, the
general symbol for a great number. From each of the twelve tribes
of Israel are sealed twelve thousand (chap. 7:4-8), making for the
symbolical number of the redeemed twelve times twelve thousand
(chap. 14:1, 3); and the walls of the New Jerusalem are in every
direction twelve thousand furlongs (chap. 21:16).</p>
<p><i>Ten</i> is possibly only a symbol of diversity, as in the
case of the ten horns of the beast (chaps. 12:3; 13:1; 17:3);
though some take a literal view of it.</p>
<p>6. Dark as are many parts of the Apocalypse and difficult of
interpretation, the book as a whole is radiant with the promise to
God's people of a final and complete victory in their conflict with
the kingdom of Satan. Though long delayed, as we mortals reckon
time, it shall come at last with a splendor above the brightness of
the sun, and the earth be lighted from pole to pole with its glory.
"Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus"!</p>

<h2>APPENDIX TO PART III.</h2>
<h3>WRITINGS OF THE APOSTOLIC FATHERS, WITH SOME NOTICES OF THE
APOCRYPHAL NEW TESTAMENT WRITINGS.</h3>
<p>1. A wide distinction should be made between the <i>writings of
the apostolic fathers</i> which are acknowledged to be genuine, or
the genuineness of which may be maintained on more or less probable
grounds, and the large mass of spurious works afterwards palmed
upon the Christian world as the productions of apostles or their
contemporaries. The latter constitute properly the <i>New Testament
Apocrypha</i>, though the term is sometimes applied in a loose way
to both classes of writings. The writings of the apostolic fathers,
though possessing no divine authority, are valuable as showing the
state of the Christian churches at the time when they were composed
in respect to both doctrine and discipline, as well as the various
errors and divisions by which they were troubled. Their testimonies
to the genuineness of the New Testament have been already
considered. Chap. 2, No. 10. Some of the apocryphal works also,
worthless as they are for instruction in the doctrines and duties
of Christianity, throw much light on the religious spirit,
tendencies, and heretical sects of the times to which they belong.
Others of these writings are unutterably absurd and puerile, worthy
of notice only as showing the type of the puerilities current in
the age of their composition.</p>
<h3>I. WRITINGS OF CLEMENT.</h3>
<p>2. Appended to the Alexandrine manuscript (Chap. 26, No. 5) is
an <i>epistle of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians</i>, followed
by part of a so-called second epistle to the same church. The first
of these epistles is acknowledged to be genuine. It was known to
the ancient fathers as the work of Clement of Rome, and highly
commended by them. Their quotations from it agree with the contents
of the epistle as we now have it, nor does it exhibit any marks of
a later age; for the author's reference to the well-known fable of
the phoenix as a type of the resurrection (chap. 25), constitutes
no real difficulty. It may prove that he was credulous, but not
that he belonged to a later than the apostolic age. The ancients
represent this Clement to have been identical with <i>Clement
bishop of Rome</i>. Whether he was also identical with the Clement
named by the apostle Paul (Phil. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page512" id="page512"></a>{512}</span> 4:3), is a question that we
may well leave undecided. The epistle was written shortly after
some persecution (chap. 1), which Grabe, Hefele, and others suppose
to have been that under Nero; Lardner, Cotelerius, and others, that
under Domitian. Upon the former supposition it was written about
A.D. 68&mdash;a supposition apparently favored by the way in which
he refers to the temple and service at Jerusalem as still in
existence (chaps. 40, 41); upon the latter, about A.D. 96 or
97.</p>
<p>3. The <i>occasion</i> of the epistle, which Clement writes in
the name of the church at Rome, is easily gathered from its
contents. As in the days of Paul, so now, the Corinthian church was
troubled by a "wicked and unholy sedition," fomented by "a few rash
and self-willed men," who had proceeded so far as to thrust out of
their ministry some worthy men. Chap. 44. It would seem, also, from
chaps. 24-27 that there were among them those who denied the
doctrine of the resurrection. To restore in the Corinthian church
the spirit of love and unity is the grand scope of the epistle. The
author commends them for their orderly and holy deportment before
their present quarrel arose, traces it to its true source in the
pride gendered by the honor and enlargement granted them by God,
and urges them to lay aside their contentions by every motive that
the gospel offers&mdash;the mischiefs that strife occasions, the
rules of their religion, the example of the Saviour and holy men of
all ages, the relation of believers to God, his high value of the
spirit of love and unity, the reward of obedience and punishment of
disobedience, etc. Comparing the church to an army, he insists
earnestly on the necessity of different ranks and orders, and the
spirit of obedience. Comparing it again to the human body, he shows
that all the particular members, each in his place, should conspire
together for the preservation of the whole.</p>
<p>Clement's style has not the merit of compactness and
conciseness. He is, on the contrary, diffuse and repetitious. But a
thoroughly evangelical spirit pervades the present epistle, and it
is, moreover, characterized by a noble fervor and simplicity. "It
evinces the calm dignity and the practical executive wisdom of the
Roman church in her original apostolic simplicity, without the
slightest infusion of hierarchical arrogance." Schaff, Hist.
Christ. Church, vol. 1, p. 460. In its internal character, as in
the time of its composition, it approaches the canonical writings
of the New Testament more nearly than any other remains of
antiquity.</p>
<p>4. The <i>second</i> epistle ascribed to Clement is not
mentioned by any of the fathers before Eusebius, who speaks of it
doubtingiy: "But it should be known that there is said to be also a
certain second epistle of Clement. But it is clear to us that this
is not equally known with the first, for we know that the ancients
have not made use of it." Hist. Eccles. 3. 38. It is generally
acknowledged to be spurious, and is, perhaps, as Hefele suggests,
one of the homilies falsely ascribed to Clement. With this
supposition <span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id=
"page513"></a>{513}</span> its contents well agree; for it does not
seem to have, like the first, a definite end to accomplish. It
opens with a general exhortation that the Corinthians should think
worthily of Christ in view of the great work which he has wrought
in their behalf, and urges upon them a steadfast confession of him
before men, not by empty words, but by a life of holy obedience. It
sets before them the incompatibility of the service of God and
mammon, and dwells with especial earnestness on the high rewards of
eternity in comparison with the pleasures and pains of the present
life; as if the writer had in mind those who were exposed to the
double peril of substituting an empty profession for the living
spirit of obedience, and of apostatizing from Christ through fear
of persecution and martyrdom.</p>
<p>5. Besides the above, there is a mass of writings current in
ancient days under the name of Clement which are acknowledged by
all to be spurious. Among these are: The <i>Recognitions of
Clement</i>; The <i>Clementines</i>, or, according to the Greek
title, <i>Clement's Epitome of Peter's Discourses in Travel</i>;
<i>Clement's Epitome concerning the Acts and Discourses of Peter in
Travel</i>&mdash;three forms of substantially the same work. It
will be sufficient to give a brief notice of the Recognitions. The
author, apparently a Jew by birth and a philosopher of the
Alexandrine school, has embraced a form of Christianity mixed up
with the dogmas of his philosophy. For the purpose of attacking and
overthrowing the false religious notions of his age, he invents an
ingenious historic plot. Clement, a Roman citizen, who, as appears
in the sequel, has been separated in early life from his father,
mother, and two brothers, whom he supposes to be dead, is
introduced as sending to James, who presides over the church at
Jerusalem, with an accompanying letter, an account of his early
education; his acquaintance with the apostle Peter, who chooses him
to be his companion in travel; Peter's conversations with himself
and the rest of the company; his public addresses and acts;
especially his famous encounters with Simon Magus, whom he
overthrows and puts to public shame. In the course of their
journeying they visit a certain island, where they meet with a poor
woman begging alms, who is found, upon the relation of her history,
to be the mother of Clement. Upon farther inquiry it appears that
two of Peter's company, Nicetus and Aquila, are her sons and the
brothers of Clement. Finally, Peter encounters on the sea-shore,
whither he had gone to perform for the newly discovered mother and
sons the rite of baptism, an old man who is found to be the long
lost husband and father. From these <i>recognitions</i> the work
receives its title. But this historic plot is only the occasion of
introducing the writer's theological and philosophical opinions,
with especial reference to the prevailing errors of his day. Any
page of the work is sufficient to show that Peter and Clement had
nothing to do with its composition. It cannot be placed earlier
than the close of the second or the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page514" id="page514"></a>{514}</span> beginning of the third
century. Prefixed to these Clementine writings, and having
reference to them, are two spurious epistles, one from Peter to
James, president of the church at Jerusalem, with the proceedings
of James consequent upon the reception of it, and one from Clement
to James. These it is not necessary to notice.</p>
<p>The so-called <i>Constitutions of Clement</i> in eight books,
embracing, as their name indicates, a system of rules pertaining to
church order and discipline, were certainly not the work of
Clement. It is not certain that they had their origin as a whole in
the same age; but the judgment of learned men is that no part of
them is older than the second half of the third century. The
eighty-five so-called <i>Apostolic Canons</i> have prefixed to them
the spurious title: "Ecclesiastical Rules of the Holy Apostles
promulgated by Clement High Priest (Pontifex) of the Church of
Rome." The origin of these canons is uncertain. They first appear
as a collection with the above title in the latter part of the
fifth century. How much older some of them may be cannot be
determined with certainty.</p>
<h3>II. THE EPISTLES OF IGNATIUS.</h3>
<p>6. <i>Ignatius</i> was bishop of the church at Antioch, and
suffered martyrdom at Rome by exposure to wild beasts A.D. 107, or
according to some accounts, A.D. 116. Of the <i>fifteen</i>
epistles ascribed to him, it is agreed among biblical scholars that
<i>eight</i> are spurious and of later origin. The remaining seven
are generally regarded as genuine, but the text of these, as of all
the rest, is in a very unsatisfactory condition. There are two
Greek recensions, a longer and a shorter, the latter containing
approximately the true text, though not without the suspicion of
interpolations. There is a Syriac version containing but three of
Ignatius' epistles, and these in a much reduced form (which some
are inclined to regard as the only genuine epistles); also an
Armenian version containing thirteen epistles. See further Schaff,
Hist. Chris. Church, vol. 1, pp. 469-471. As the question now
stands, we may with good reason receive as genuine the seven
mentioned by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl. 3. 36) and Jerome (De Viris
illust. 16). They were all written on his last journey to Rome;
four from Smyrna, where Polycarp was the bishop, to the Ephesians,
Magnesians, Trallians, and Romans; three after his departure from
Smyrna, to the churches of Philadelphia and Smyrna, and to Polycarp
bishop of Smyrna. The native vigor and energy of Ignatius, as also
the depth and sincerity of his piety, shine forth conspicuously in
these letters; but they differ from the epistle of Clement in the
manifestation of an intense ecclesiastical spirit, by which,
indeed, they are marked as belonging to a later era of the church.
If we except the epistle to the Romans, they all abound in
exhortations to render implicit obedience to their spiritual rulers
as to Christ himself. To <span class="pagenum"><a name="page515"
id="page515"></a>{515}</span> these precepts he adds exhortations
to maintain unity, and to avoid false doctrines, specifying
particularly Judaizing teachers and such as deny our Lord's proper
humanity.</p>
<p>We cannot read his letter to the Romans, among whom he expected
shortly to lay down his life for Christ's sake, without deep
interest. But it is marred by the manifestation of an undue desire
to obtain the crown of martyrdom, which leads him to protest
against any interposition of the Roman brethren in his behalf. "I
beseech you," says he, "show no unseasonable good-will towards me.
Suffer me to be the food of wild beasts, by means of which I may
attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and am ground by the teeth of
wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of God." Chap. 4.
His letter to Polycarp, a fellow bishop, abounds in precepts for
the right discharge of his duties. It is interesting as showing
Ignatius' idea, on the one side, of the office with its high
responsibilities, and, on the other, of the duties which the
churches owe to those who are set over them in the Lord.</p>
<p>7. There are some spurious epistles ascribed to Ignatius which
it is sufficient simply to name. These are: A letter to one Maria a
proselyte of Cilicia in answer to her request that certain young
men might be sent to her people as their spiritual guides; epistles
to the church of Tarsus, of Antioch, and of
Philippi&mdash;theological dissertations mostly made up of texts of
Scripture; a letter to Hero a deacon, containing precepts for the
right discharge of his office, and abounding, like those just
named, in quotations from Scripture: two pretended letters of
Ignatius to the apostle John; one to the Virgin Mary, with her
reply.</p>
<p>Finally, there are some fragments of Ignatius' writings
preserved to us in the quotations of the ancients, which it is not
necessary to notice.</p>
<h3>III. THE EPISTLE OF POLYCARP.</h3>
<p>8. <i>Polycarp</i> was a disciple of the apostle John, and
presided over the church in Smyrna. He suffered martyrdom about the
year 166. Of his writings only one short epistle remains, addressed
by him to the Philippians soon after the martyrdom of Ignatius, who
passed through Smyrna on his way to Rome. This we gather from the
letter itself; for in this he assumes that Ignatius has already
suffered (chap. 9), and yet he has not heard the particulars
concerning his fate and that of his companions. Chap. 14. This
brief epistle is marked by a fervor and simplicity worthy of an
apostolic man. The writer commends the Philippians for the love
manifested by them towards the suffering servants of Christ,
exhorts them to steadfastness, reminds them of Paul's precepts in
his epistle to them, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id=
"page516"></a>{516}</span> and proceeds to unfold and inculcate the
duties belonging to the officers and several classes of members in
the church. The immediate occasion of the letter seems to have been
his transmission to the Philippians, in compliance with their
request, of Ignatius' epistle to himself, with such others of his
epistles as had come into his hands. Chap. 13. The preservation of
the present epistle is probably due to this its connection with the
epistles of Ignatius forwarded by him to the Philippians.</p>
<h3>IV. THE WRITINGS OF BARNABAS AND HERMAS.</h3>
<p>9. The writings current under the names of <i>Barnabas</i> and
<i>Hermas</i> have by no means the outward testimony in their favor
by which the preceding epistles of Clement, Ignatius, and Polycarp
are supported; nor the inward evidence arising from the
consideration of their contents. We will consider them briefly in
the order abovenamed.</p>
<p>10. Until recently the first part of the <i>Epistle of
Barnabas</i> existed only in a Latin version. But in 1859
Tischendorf discovered at Mount Sinai the Sinai Codex (Chap. 26,
No. 5), which contains the entire epistle in the original Greek.
That the writer was the Barnabas mentioned in the New Testament as
the companion of Paul in preaching the gospel, cannot be maintained
on any firm basis of evidence. As to the date of its composition
learned men differ. Hefele places it between the years 107 and 120.
Apostolic Fathers, Prolegomena, p. 15.</p>
<p>The writer was apparently a Hellenistic Jew of the Alexandrine
school, and he wrote for the purpose of convincing his brethren,
mainly from the Old Testament, that Jesus is the Messiah, and that
in him the rites of the Mosaic law are done away. His quotations
from the Old Testament are numerous, and his method of
interpretation is allegorical and sometimes very fanciful, as in
the following passage, for the right understanding of which the
reader should know that the two Greek letters [Greek: I&Ecirc;],
which stand first in the name [Greek: I&Ecirc;SOUS], JESUS, and
represent that name by abbreviation, signify as numerals, the first
<i>ten</i>, the second, <i>eight</i>; also that the Greek letter
[Greek: T] (the sign of the cross) denotes as a numeral, <i>three
hundred</i>. "The Scripture says," argues Barnabas, "that Abraham
circumcised of his house <i>three hundred and eighteen men</i>.
What was the knowledge communicated to him [in this fact]? Learn
first the meaning of the <i>eighteen</i>, then of the <i>three
hundred</i>. Now the numeral letters [Greek: I], <i>ten</i>,
[Greek: &Ecirc;], <i>eight</i>, make <i>eighteen</i>. Here you have
<i>Jesus</i> (Greek [Greek: I&Ecirc;SOUN], of which the
abbreviation is [Greek: I&Ecirc;]). And because the cross, which
lies in the letter [Greek: T], was that which should bring grace,
he says also <i>three hundred</i>." Chap. 9. The Rabbinic system of
interpretation in which the writer was educated furnishes an
<i>explanation</i>, indeed, of this and other like puerilities, but
no <i>vindication</i> of them.</p>
<p>11. The <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i>, as the work current under the
name of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id=
"page517"></a>{517}</span> Hermas is called, consists of three
books&mdash;his Visions, his Commands, and his Similitudes. The
four visions are received through the ministry of an aged woman,
who is the church of Christ. The twelve commands and ten
similitudes are received from one who appears to him "in the habit
of a shepherd, clothed with a white cloak, having his bag upon his
back, and his staff in his hand," whence the title The
<i>Shepherd</i> of Hermas. All these are intended to unfold the
truths of Christianity with its doctrines and duties. The writer
has a most luxuriant imagination. In reading his books,
particularly the first and the third, one sometimes finds himself
bewildered in a thicket of images and similitudes, some of them
grotesque and not altogether congruous. Yet the work throws much
light on the religious ideas and tendencies of its age.</p>
<p>The ancients speak doubtingly of the authority of this work.
Origen, whom Eusebius and Jerome follow, ascribes it to the Hermas
mentioned in the epistle to the Romans (chap. 16:14); though it
does not appear that he had any other ground for this than the
identity of the name. The Muratorian canon names as its author
Hermas the brother of Pius bishop of Rome. According to this, which
is the more probable view, the date of its composition would be
about the middle of the second century.</p>
<h3>V. THE APOSTLES' CREED.</h3>
<p>12. We put this among the remains of the apostolic fathers, not
because there is any doubt as to its containing the substance of
the doctrines taught by the apostles, but because, as is generally
admitted, it did not receive its present form at their hand.
"Though not traceable in its present shape before the third
century, and found in the second in different longer or shorter
forms, it is in substance altogether apostolic, and exhibits an
incomparable summary of the leading facts in the revelation of the
triune God from the creation of the world to the resurrection of
the body; and that in a form intelligible to all, and admirably
suited for public worship and catechetical use." Schaff, Hist.
Chris. Church, pp. 121, 122.</p>
<h3>VI. APOCRYPHAL GOSPELS AND ACTS.</h3>
<p>13. These are very numerous. Under the head of Apocryphal
Gospels. Tischendorf has published twenty-two works; under that of
Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, thirteen. To the student of church
history they are not without value; for they illustrate the origin
of many ancient traditions and some ritual observances. But if we
look to their intrinsic character, they may be described as a mass
of worthless legends abounding in absurd and puerile stories. The
contrast between the miracles which they relate and the true
miracles recorded in the canonical gospels and Acts is <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>{518}</span> immense,
and such as makes the darkness of these spurious writings more
visible. The miracles of the canonical books have always a worthy
occasion, and are connected with the Saviour's work of redemption.
But the pretended miracles of the apocryphal writings are, as a
general rule, wrought on trivial occasions, with either no end in
view but the display of supernatural power, or with a positively
unlawful end, whence it not unfrequently happens that their impiety
rivals their absurdity. Many samples of both these characters could
be given, but the general reader may well remain ignorant of
them.</p>

<h2>PRINCIPLES OF BIBLICAL INTERPRETATION.</h2>
<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h3>
<p>1. The term <i>Hermeneutics</i> (Greek, <i>hermeneuo</i>, <i>to
interpret</i>) is commonly employed to denote the <i>principles of
scriptural interpretation</i>. The Greek word
<i>exegesis</i>&mdash;that is, <i>exposition</i>&mdash;denotes the
actual <i>work of interpretation</i>. Hermeneutics is, therefore,
the <i>science</i> of interpretation; Exegesis, the
<i>application</i> of this science to the word of God. The
hermeneutical writer lays down general principles of
interpretation; the exegetical writer uses these principles in the
exposition of Scripture. The terms <i>epexegesis</i> and
<i>epexegetical</i> are used by expositors in a special sense to
denote something explanatory of the immediate context.</p>
<p>2. The expositor's <i>office</i> is, to ascertain and unfold the
true meaning of the inspired writers, without adding to it,
subtracting from it, or changing it in any way. Here we may draw an
instructive parallel between his work and that of the textual
critic. The textual critic aims to give, not what some one might
think the inspired penman should have written, but what he actually
did write. So the true expositor, taking the very words of
Scripture, seeks not to force upon them a meaning in harmony with
his preconceived opinions, but to take from them the very ideas
which the writer intended to express. It is pertinent, therefore,
to consider at the outset the qualifications which belong to the
biblical interpreter. These include high moral and intellectual
qualities, as well as varied and extensive acquirements.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id=
"page522"></a>{522}</span>
<p>3. Foremost among the qualities that belong to the interpreter
is a <i>supreme regard for truth</i>. A general conviction and
acknowledgment of the duty of truthfulness will not be sufficient
to guard him against all the seductive influences that beset his
path. Though he may be a sincere Christian, he will still be in
danger of being misled by the power of preconceived opinions and
party connections. He will need a constant and vivid apprehension
of the sacredness of all truth, more especially of scriptural
truth, which God has revealed for the sanctification and salvation
of men. "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." These
words of the Saviour he will do well to ponder night and day, till
they become a part of his spiritual life; and to remember always
that, if such be the divine origin and high office of scriptural
truth, God will not hold guiltless any who tamper with it in the
interest of preconceived human opinions, thus substituting the
folly of man for the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>4. The interpreter further needs a <i>sound judgment</i>,
combined with the power of <i>vivid conception</i>. These two
qualities are named together, because they mutually supplement each
other. A large part of the Bible is occupied with description. Here
the interpreter needs the power of conception, that he may bring
before his mind a vivid picture of the scenes described, with the
relations of their several parts to each other. Another large part
of the Bible contains the language of poetry and impassioned
feeling. In the interpretation of this, the faculty of conception
is especially necessary, that we may place ourselves as fully as
possible in the circumstances of the writers, and form a true idea
of the emotions which filled their minds and gave form and
complexion to their utterances. Pure cold logic, with the addition
of any amount of human learning, will not enable us to comprehend
and expound aright the forty-second Psalm. By the power of
imagination, we must go with the poet, in his exile from the
sanctuary at Jerusalem, across the Jordan to the land of the
Hermonites; must see his distressed and forsaken condition; must
hear the bitter taunts of his enemies; <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>{523}</span> must
witness the inward tempest of his feelings&mdash;a continual
conflict between nature and faith&mdash;before we can have a true
understanding of his words. The same might be said of innumerable
other passages of Scripture.</p>
<p>But this power of vivid conception, when not held in check by a
<i>sound judgment</i>, will lead the expositor of Scripture into
the wildest vagaries of fancy. Disregarding the plainest rules of
interpretation, he will cover up the obvious sense of Scripture
with a mass of allegorical expositions, under color of educing from
the words of inspiration a higher and more edifying meaning. That
high natural endowments, united with varied and solid learning and
indefatigable zeal for the gospel, do not of themselves constitute
a safeguard against this error, we learn from the example of Origen
and many others. Not content to let the simple narratives of
Scripture speak for themselves and convey their proper lessons of
instruction, these allegorical expositors force upon them a higher
spiritual sense. In so doing, they unsettle the very principles by
which the spiritual doctrines of Scripture are established.</p>
<p>Origen, for example, in commenting on the meeting between
Abraham's servant and Rebecca at the well in Haran, says: "Rebecca
came every day to the wells. Therefore she could be found by
Abraham's servant, and joined in marriage with Isaac." Thus he
gives the literal meaning of this transaction. But he then goes on
to show, among other things, that Rebecca represents the human
soul, which Christ wishes to betroth to himself, while Abraham's
servant is "the prophetic word, which unless you first receive, you
cannot be married to Christ." See in Davidson's Sacred
Hermeneutics, pp. 103, 104.</p>
<p>5. Another indispensable qualification of scriptural
interpretation is <i>sympathy with divine truth</i>; in other
words, that harmony of spirit with the truths of revelation which
comes from a hearty reception of them, and a subjection of the
whole life, inward and outward, to their control. "If any man,"
said our Saviour, "will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." John 7:17. In
these words our Lord proposed to the unbelieving <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>{524}</span> Jews the
true remedy for their ignorance and error respecting his person and
office, which had their ground not in the want of evidence, but in
their perverse and guilty rejection of evidence. Their moral state
was one of habitual rebellion against the truth of God; and they
could not, therefore, have sympathy with the Saviour's doctrine.
They hated the light, and would not come to the light, because
their deeds were evil. John 3:20. What they needed was not more
light, but that obedient spirit which loves the light, and allows
it to shine through the soul. The man who would be a successful
interpreter of God's word must begin where the Saviour directed
these Jews to begin. So far as he knows the truth, he must give it
a hearty reception not in theory alone, but in daily practice. Then
he will be prepared to make further progress in the knowledge of
it, and to unfold its heavenly treasures to his fellow-men. But if
he comes to the study of God's word with a heart habitually at
variance with its holy precepts, and an understanding darkened by
the power of sinful affections, no amount of scholarship or
critical sagacity will avail to make him a true expositor of its
contents. Having no sympathy with the great foundation doctrines of
the gospel, but regarding them with positive aversion, he will
neither be able to apprehend them in their true light, nor to
explain them aright to his fellow-men. In the work of
interpretation, a good heart&mdash;good in the scriptural
sense&mdash;is not less important than a clear understanding and
well-furnished mind.</p>
<p>6. How extensive and varied should be the <i>acquirements</i> of
the able interpreter will be manifest to any one who considers the
extent and variety of the fields of knowledge covered by the Holy
Scriptures.</p>
<p>The <i>languages</i> in which they are written are no longer
spoken. The knowledge of them, like that of all dead languages, is
locked up in books&mdash;grammars, lexicons, ancient versions, and
various subsidiary helps&mdash;and can be mastered only by severe
and protracted study. It is not indeed necessary that the great
body of Christians, or even all preachers of the gospel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id=
"page525"></a>{525}</span> should be able to read the Bible in the
original languages. But it is a principle of Protestantism, the
soundness of which has been confirmed by the experience of
centuries, that there should always be in the churches a body of
men able to go behind the current versions of Scripture to the
original tongues from which these versions were executed. The
commentator, at least, must not take his expositions at second
hand; and a healthy tone of feeling in regard to the sacredness and
supreme authority of the inspired word will always demand that
there should be a goodly number of scholars scattered through the
churches who can judge from the primitive sources of the
correctness of his interpretations.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are crowded with references to the cities,
mountains, plains, deserts, rivers, and seas of Palestine and the
surrounding regions; to their climate, soil, animals, and plants;
to their agricultural products and mineral treasures; to the course
of travel and commerce between the different nations; in a word, to
those numerous particulars which come under the head of
<i>geography</i> and <i>natural history</i>. The extended
investigations of modern times in these departments of knowledge
have shed a great light over the pages of inspiration, which no
expositor who is worthy of the name will venture to neglect.</p>
<p>And if one collect and illustrate the various allusions of
Scripture to the manners and customs of the ancient Hebrews, to
their civil institutions and their religious rites and ceremonies,
he will compose a volume on <i>biblical antiquities</i>.</p>
<p>The connection, moreover, which the covenant people had with the
surrounding nations, especially the great monarchies which
successively held sway over the civilized world&mdash;Egypt,
Assyria, Chaldea, Greece, Rome&mdash;requires an extended knowledge
of <i>ancient history</i>, and, as inseparably connected with this,
of <i>ancient chronology</i>. Biblical chronology constitutes,
indeed, a science of itself, embracing some very perplexed and
difficult questions, the solution of which has an important bearing
upon the passages of Scripture to which they have reference.</p>
<p>7. We do not affirm that all the above-named qualifications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page526" id=
"page526"></a>{526}</span> are necessary to a saving knowledge of
God's word. Its great essential doctrines and precepts are so plain
that the unlettered reader, who brings to the work an honest heart,
cannot fail to understand them. In this respect God has made the
vision so plain "that he may run that readeth it;" and the road to
heaven so direct that "the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not
err therein." But the interpreter of Scripture is expected to
unfold the meaning of the difficult passages also, as far as human
investigation will enable him to do so. They are a part of "all
Scripture given by inspiration of God," which the apostle affirms
to be "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness." He should spare no effort,
therefore, to ascertain their exact sense, and to expound this
sense to others with all possible fidelity and clearness.</p>
<p>8. There is a <i>human</i> and a <i>divine</i> side to biblical
interpretation&mdash;a human side, because the Scriptures address
men in human language, and according to human modes of thinking and
speaking; a divine side, because they contain a true revelation
from God to men, and differ in this respect from all other
writings. The neglect of the human side leads to visionary schemes
of interpretation, in which the writer's fancy is substituted for
the sober rules of criticism, and the word of God accommodated to
his preconceived opinions. The rejection, open or covert, of the
divine side, manifests itself in a cold, skeptical criticism, which
denies or explains away all that is supernatural in the Bible;
which, instead of seeking to discover and unfold that unity of plan
and harmony of parts which belong to every work of God, delights
rather in exaggerating the supposed inconsistencies and
contradictions of the sacred writers, and in arraying one part of
Scripture against another; and which, having no faith itself in the
Bible as containing a revelation from God, infuses doubts
respecting its divine origin into the mind of the reader. It is
only by keeping steadily in view these two sides of revelation,
which mutually supplement each other, that we can attain to a true
knowledge of the inspired word.</p>

<h2>FIRST DIVISION.</h2>
<h3>INTERPRETATION VIEWED ON THE HUMAN SIDE.</h3>
<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION.</h3>
<p>1. Since the Bible addresses men in human language, and
according to human modes of thinking and speaking, the
interpreter's first work is to ascertain the <i>meaning of the
terms</i> employed. Here he must proceed as in the case of other
writings, seeking by the aid of grammars, lexicons, cognate
languages, ancient versions, ancient interpreters, and whatever
other outward helps are available, to gain a thorough knowledge of
the language employed by the Holy Spirit in his revelations to men.
To these external sources of knowledge he will add all the internal
light which comes from a careful consideration of the context, of
the author's known use of terms, of parallel passages, etc.</p>
<p>In the case of the New Testament, a knowledge of classical Greek
will not be sufficient. The interpreter must superadd a thorough
acquaintance with the peculiar dialect of the New Testament (Chap.
24, No. 5), and also the special usages of particular writers. The
apostle John, to adduce a single instance, applies the term
<i>Logos</i>, <i>Word</i>, to the Son of God. But we cannot argue
from this for a like usage by other writers; as, for example, in
the well-known passage: "The word of God is quick and powerful,"
etc. Heb. 4:12.</p>
<p>Usage alone is often insufficient to determine the meaning of a
word in a particular passage; for (1) the term may occur nowhere
else, (2) it may have in current usage two or more different
significations. In the former case, the interpreter must avail
himself of all the external helps above specified, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>{528}</span> and
especially of the light shed upon the meaning of the term in
question by the context. In the latter case, the context must be
his chief guide. The same Greek word, for example, signifies
<i>stature</i> (Luke 19:3) and <i>age</i> (Heb. 11:11). In the
interpretation of Matt. 6:27, where our version reads: "Which of
you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?" the
question may naturally enough arise in which of these two senses
the Saviour employed it. Whatever may be the decision, it must have
for its basis not simple usage, which is ambiguous, but the
connection of the word in the context. Many like examples might be
adduced.</p>
<p>It has been already remarked (Chap. 24, No. 5) that in New
Testament usage many words have a technical and therefore peculiar
meaning. We are not at liberty, however, to determine such
technical meanings at random, or in accordance with any
preconceived opinions. It can only be done, as in the case of all
other writings, in accordance with the acknowledged laws of
interpretation. The general result, then, at which we arrive is,
that in determining the meaning of scriptural terms we must be
guided by the same rules which we follow in the interpretation of
other writings.</p>
<p>2. From the signification of particular words we proceed to the
consideration of the <i>sense</i> embodied in the language of the
sacred writers. A knowledge of the words which enter into the
composition of a sentence does not of itself give us a true
apprehension of the sense which the writer seeks to convey. We must
know the writer's aim, the shape and course of his argument, the
ideas which he is combating as well as those which he seeks to
establish, the emphatic words of the sentence, whether he wishes to
be understood literally or figuratively, and various other
particulars; all which are to be ascertained by the same rules
which we employ in the interpretation of language generally.</p>
<p>3. The <i>scope</i> or <i>design</i> of the inspired writer may
be <i>general</i> or <i>special</i>; the former being his design in
writing the whole work in question, the latter, his design in
particular sections of it. "The scope," it has been well observed,
"is the soul or spirit of a book; and, that being once ascertained,
every argument and every word appears in its right place, and is
perfectly intelligible; but if the scope be not duly considered,
every thing becomes obscure, however clear and obvious its meaning
may really be." Horne's Introduct., vol. 2, p. 265, edit. of 1860.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page529" id=
"page529"></a>{529}</span> This language is not too strong. It is
by a neglect or perversion of the scope that the meaning of the
inspired writers is perverted, and they are made to contradict one
another.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, for example: "Therefore we conclude that
a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law." Rom.
3:28. The apostle James: "Ye see then how that by works a man is
justified, and not by faith only." James 2:24. If one insists on
leaving out of account the separate and distinct design which each
of these two writers had in view respectively, he can easily bring
their words into contradiction. Had the scope of Paul's argument
been to show that faith in Christ <i>releases</i> men from the
obligation of obeying the divine law, and thus makes good works
unnecessary; or had James been laboring to prove that good works
are the <i>meritorious ground</i> of men's forgiveness, then the
doctrines of the two apostles would have been irreconcilably at
variance. But we know that neither of these suppositions is true.
Paul was combating the error of the Pharisees "who trusted in
themselves that they were righteous"&mdash;righteous on the ground
of "the deeds of the law"&mdash;"and despised others." His aim was
to show that men receive forgiveness and salvation neither wholly
nor in part on the ground of the supposed merit of their good
works, but wholly through faith in Christ; as he elsewhere argues
that "if it be by grace, then it is no more of works: otherwise
grace is no more grace." Rom. 11:6. We know also, from the whole
tenor of his writings, that he condemned as spurious that pretended
faith which does not manifest itself in good works. In this very
epistle, where the question is not concerning the meritorious
ground of justification, but concerning that character which God
will accept, the apostle lays down the great principle: "Unto them
that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish,
upon every soul of man that doeth evil; of the Jew first, and also
of the Gentile; but glory, honor, and peace to every man that
worketh good; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: for there
is no respect of persons with God." Rom. 2:8-11. If now we turn to
the epistle of James, we find that the faith without works which he
condemns as dead is one of mere empty notions&mdash;an inoperative
belief <i>about</i> Christ instead of that hearty trust <i>in</i>
him which brings the heart and life into subjection to his
authority. In a word, Paul condemns, as dead, works without faith;
James, faith without works. The one rejects dead works (Heb. 9:14);
the other, dead faith. Between these two judgments there is no
contradiction. We have dwelt somewhat at large upon this example of
alleged contradiction for the purpose of full illustration. The
same mode of reasoning might be applied to many other passages,
where a knowledge of the writer's design is essential to the true
apprehension of his meaning.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id=
"page530"></a>{530}</span>
<p>Such being the importance of the scope, the question arises: How
shall it be ascertained? Here mechanical rules will be of little
avail. The attentive and judicious reader will be able, in general,
to gather it from the various indications given by the writer
himself, or from the known circumstances in which he wrote, just as
in the case of other writings.</p>
<p>Sometimes an author directly <i>states</i> his general end, or
his design in writing a particular section of his work. An example
of the former kind is John 20:31: "These things are written that ye
might believe that Jesus is the Son of God; and that believing ye
might have life through his name;" of the latter kind, 1 Cor. 7:1:
"Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me," etc.; whence
we learn that in this particular chapter the apostle's design is to
answer certain inquiries of the Corinthian Christians in regard to
the relation of marriage. More commonly the writer's scope is
indicated indirectly by various <i>inferential remarks</i>, as in
the passage already quoted: "Therefore we conclude that a man is
justified by faith without the deeds of the law," which is in fact
a statement of the apostle's design in the preceding argument. See
Horne's Introduct., vol. 2, pp. 266, 267, where the author follows
Morus, Hermeneutica, 1.2.2.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clear light is shed upon the design of a writer or
speaker by a knowledge of <i>historical circumstances</i>;
especially, of his own position and that of his opponents. The
twenty-third chapter of Matthew, in which the Saviour exposes the
wickedness and doctrinal errors of the scribes and Pharisees, and
denounces upon them the judgments of heaven, cannot be thoroughly
understood without a knowledge of the system of Pharisaism, and the
high position of authority and influence which the Pharisees held;
sitting, as they did, in Moses' seat, imposing upon the people
their human traditions in place of God's commandments, substituting
a religion of outward forms for one of inward faith, love, and
obedience, and thus taking away from the people the key of divine
knowledge. It was necessary that the Son of God, to whom the church
belonged, who came to shed his blood for her redemption, and to
establish her in the principles of truth and holiness, should
expose with unsparing severity the wickedness and ignorance of
these scribes and Pharisees, for the instruction of his people in
all coming ages. A knowledge of the same historical circumstances
throws a strong light on the apostle's aim in writing to the Romans
and Galatians. Had we fuller information respecting the false
teachers referred to in the epistle to the Colossians and the
pastoral epistles, we should understand more clearly the apostle's
arguments against them.</p>
<p>But the surest means of ascertaining a writer's scope is the
repeated <span class="pagenum"><a name="page531" id=
"page531"></a>{531}</span> and careful perusal of his words. The
biblical student should early form the habit of reading over with
earnest attention a whole book at a sitting&mdash;the epistle to
the Romans, for example, or that to the Hebrews&mdash;without
pausing to investigate particular questions; his aim being to throw
himself as fully as possible into the general current of thought,
and to be carried forward by it to the writer's final conclusions.
When he has thus made himself familiar with the scope of the work
as a whole, he will be better prepared for the examination of the
particular difficulties that offer themselves in the course of the
author's argument.</p>
<p>4. The word <i>context</i> (Latin, <i>contextus</i>) signifies
literally <i>a weaving together</i>; and is appropriately used,
therefore, to denote the web of a writer's discourse. The scope is
the <i>end</i> which a writer proposes to accomplish: the context
gives the <i>form and manner of its accomplishment</i>. With
reference to a given passage, the context has been loosely defined
to be that which immediately precedes and follows. More accurately,
it is the series of statements, arguments, and illustrations
connected with the passage whose meaning is sought, including all
the various connections of thought. The sober interpreter, then,
must have constant reference to the context, as well for the
signification of particular terms as for the general sense of the
passage under consideration. To interpret without regard to the
context is to interpret at random; to interpret contrary to the
context is to teach falsehood for truth.</p>
<p>The necessity of having constant reference to the context for
the determination of the sense, as well as of the particular terms
employed, admits of innumerable illustrations. From these we select
a few examples:</p>
<p>In Rom. 14:23 the apostle lays down the following maxim: "He
that doubteth is damned [literally, <i>condemned</i>] if he eat,
because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is
sin." The context relates not to the Lord's supper, but to scruples
in respect to the use of particular kinds of food: "One believeth
that he may eat all things; another who is
weak"&mdash;over-scrupulous in respect to distinctions of
food&mdash;"eateth herbs" (ver. 2). Consequently there is no
reference here to the personal qualifications requisite for
partaking of that ordinance, or to the consequence of eating
unworthily. The apostle means to say that whoever has scruples
about the lawfulness of using a particular article of food is
condemned if he eat it, "because he eateth not of faith." He acts
contrary to his persuasion of duty. Thus he violates, in this
particular case, that general <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page532" id="page532"></a>{532}</span> law of faith which requires
that in all things we keep a conscience void of offence towards God
and man, subjecting ourselves in loving confidence to Christ's
authority, and doing in all things what we believe to be right in
his sight.</p>
<p>Again we read in Gal. 5:4 the words: "Ye are fallen from grace."
Taken out of their connection, these words are ambiguous in their
application. But the context makes all plain. The apostle is
addressing those who are inclined to substitute a system of
justification by works for the grace of the gospel: "Christ is
become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the
law; ye are fallen from grace"&mdash;fallen away from grace, as the
original word means. Ye have abandoned the system of grace revealed
in the gospel for one of works.</p>
<p>The psalmist says: "My soul thirsteth for God, for the living
God: when shall I come and appear before God?" Psa. 42:2. Taken out
of their connection, these words might be understood of his desire
to enjoy the beatific vision of God in heaven. But the context
shows that the writer had in mind God's earthly sanctuary, from
which he was banished: "My tears have been my meat day and night,
while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? When I
remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone
with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the
voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy-day" (ver.
3, 4).</p>
<p>Again the psalmist says: "The king's daughter is all glorious
within" (Psa. 45:13); words that have more than once been applied
directly to the inward spiritual beauty of the church, the bride of
Christ. This is, indeed, the idea that we gain from a true
interpretation of them. But it comes not directly, but through a
beautiful figure. The primary meaning of the words is, that the
royal bride appearing <i>within the palace</i> in raiment of
wrought gold is all glorious to the beholder's view. Undoubtedly
she represents the church espoused to Christ; dwelling, so to
speak, in his kingly mansion, and gloriously adorned with his
righteousness. Rev. 19:8.</p>
<p>The question may naturally occur to the reader: Within what
limits is the context to be consulted? The answer must be, that no
definite limits can be prescribed. The entire web of discourse must
be carefully studied, including the more remote as well as the
nearer context; for the inspired writers do not, as a general rule,
proceed according to formal divisions and subdivisions. The train
of argument is often interrupted by parenthetical remarks,
particularly in the writings of the apostle Paul, or it is resumed
in an informal way after extended digressions. The true connection
of thought, then, is to be gathered not so much from our modern
notions of what logical accuracy would require, as from the
repeated and careful perusal of the writing in question. In this
way alone can we place ourselves in the author's position, and look
at the subject under discussion <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page533" id="page533"></a>{533}</span> from his point of view;
that is to say, in this way alone can we enter into his modes of
thinking and reasoning, and thus qualify ourselves to be the
expounders of them to others.</p>
<p>In some cases no context exists, and none is to be sought. In a
large part of the book of Proverbs, for example, each separate
aphorism shines by its own light. If it have any connection with
what precedes or follows, it is only casual or superficial. In some
books, again, like that of Ecclesiastes, the transitions are rapid,
and often difficult to explain. Here we should be careful not to
force upon the author a logical connection of which he never
thought. Systematic arrangement is good in its place; but the Holy
Spirit did not think it needful to secure it in the case of all who
spake as he moved them.</p>
<p>Some religious teachers are fond of employing scriptural texts
simply as <i>mottoes</i>, with little or no regard to their true
connection. Thus they too often adapt them to their use by
imparting to them a factitious sense foreign to their proper scope
and meaning. The seeming gain in all such cases is more than
counterbalanced by the loss and danger that attend the practice. It
encourages the habit of interpreting Scripture in an arbitrary and
fanciful way, and thus furnishes the teachers of error with their
most effective weapon. The practice cannot be defended on any plea
of necessity. The plain words of Scripture, legitimately
interpreted according to their proper scope and context, contain a
fulness and comprehensiveness of meaning sufficient for the wants
of all men in all circumstances. That piety alone is robust and
healthful which is fed, not by the fancies and speculations of the
preacher who practically puts his own genius above the word of God,
but by the pure doctrines and precepts of the Bible, unfolded in
their true connection and meaning.</p>
<p>It is important to remark, however, that when the <i>general
principle</i> contained in a given passage of Scripture has been
once fairly explained, it admits of innumerable applications which
are in the highest sense legitimate and proper. The principle, for
example, that "whatsoever is not of faith is sin," which the
apostle Paul announces in connection with the question of using or
abstaining from particular kinds of food, may <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>{534}</span> be
applied to the settlement of cases of conscience arising in widely
different relations and spheres of action. The preacher's power
lies very much in the ability of unfolding to the understanding and
applying to the conscience the general principles involved in the
passage of Scripture which he undertakes to expound.</p>
<p>5. We may next consider the help to be derived from <i>parallel
passages</i>. The ordinary division of parallelisms is into
<i>verbal</i> and <i>real</i>: verbal, where the same word or
phrase occurs; real, where the same thought is expressed or the
same subject discussed. Verbal parallelisms often shed much light
on the meaning of particular words or phrases, because what is
obscure in one passage is made plain in another by some explanatory
addition.</p>
<p>An example is the use of the expression <i>my glory</i> (English
version, <i>my honor</i>), in Gen. 49:6: "O my soul, come not thou
into their secret" (their secret conclave); "unto their assembly,
my glory, be not thou united." A comparison of the parallel
passages, Psa. 7:5; 16:9; 30:12; 57:8; 108:1, leads to the
conclusion that in such a connection the expression is
substantially equivalent to <i>my soul</i>, the soul being made in
the image of God, and thus the seat of man's glory. By a like
process of comparison, we arrive at the true signification of the
phrase, "<i>the righteousness of God</i>," or more fully, "<i>the
righteousness which is of God by faith</i>" when used with
reference to the way of salvation through Christ; at the meaning of
the Greek terms translated "<i>propitiation</i>," etc. In the same
way, as already remarked (No. 1, above), the interpreter ascertains
the different significations in which words are employed, and
determines which of these is appropriate to any given passage.</p>
<p><i>Real</i> parallelisms are subdivided, again, into
<i>doctrinal</i> and <i>historic</i>; doctrinal, where the same
truth is inculcated; historic, where the same event or series of
events is recorded. The supreme importance of doctrinal
parallelisms will appear most fully when we come to look at
revelation on the divine side, as constituting a grand system of
truth harmonious in all its parts. At present we regard them simply
as among the means of ascertaining the sense of a given passage.
Presuming that every author means to be self-consistent, it is our
custom to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id=
"page535"></a>{535}</span> place side by side his different
statements which relate to the same subject, that they may mutually
explain each other. The same reasonable method should be pursued
with the writings of Isaiah and Jeremiah in the Old Testament, and
of Paul and John in the New. What is obscure is to be interpreted
by what is clear; what is briefly hinted, by what is more fully
expressed. Different writers, moreover, belonging to the same age,
animated by the same spirit, and confessedly governed by the same
general rules of faith and practice, mutually explain each other.
Thus the prophets Isaiah, Hosea, Joel, Amos, and Micah, who belong
to the same century, and in a less degree Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and
the other prophets of a later age, shed each a light on the pages
of all the rest. The same is true of all the epistolary writers of
the New Testament, notwithstanding their marked differences of
style, and the different aspects also in which they respectively
contemplate Christian doctrine and duty.</p>
<p>Our Saviour says of those who claimed to be, before his advent,
the shepherds and leaders of God's spiritual fold: "All that ever
came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear
them." John 10:8. Yet according to this same evangelist he honored
Abraham, Moses, and the prophets, as true leaders and teachers of
God's people. Chaps. 8:39, 40, 56; 5:45-47; 12:38-41. We know,
then, that the Saviour's words must be restricted to such spiritual
thieves and robbers as the scribes and Pharisees of his day, who
under the leadership of Satan (chap. 8:41, 44) climbed up some
other way into the fold.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says (Rom. 2:7) that God shall render "to them
who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honor,
and immortality, eternal life." We know at once, without reference
to the context, that he does not mean, in opposition to the whole
tenor of his epistles, to affirm that men can obtain eternal life
by their own well-doing, without respect to "the righteousness of
God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them
that believe." But if we examine the context, this shows that here
the apostle is not speaking of the meritorious ground of
justification, but of God's impartial regard to a righteous
character in both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p><i>Historical</i> parallelisms hold of necessity a prominent
place in the interpretation of both the Old and the New Testament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id=
"page536"></a>{536}</span> In the Old Testament we have the two
parallel histories of the Hebrew commonwealth, first in the books
of Samuel and the Kings, then in the books of Chronicles. In the
New, the four gospels are four parallel accounts of our Lord's life
and teachings. Then there are several parallelisms of less extent;
as, for example, Isaiah's account of Sennacherib's war upon
Hezekiah, and Hezekiah's sickness (Isa. chaps. 36-39, compared with
2 Kings 18:13-20:21, and the briefer notice of 2 Chron. chap. 32);
the three accounts of Paul's conversion (Acts 9:1-22; 22:1-21;
26:1-20); and other passages which will readily occur to the
reader. To the work of comparing and harmonizing these parallel
histories biblical students have with reason devoted much labor,
since they mutually supplement and illustrate each other in many
ways. We understand the books of Samuel and Kings more fully by
comparison with the books of Chronicles, and the reverse. Each of
the four gospels sheds light on the other three. It is by placing
the three accounts of Paul's conversion side by side that we gain
the most perfect knowledge of this event. The numerous coincidences
between the Acts of the Apostles and the Pauline epistles, give us
a fuller idea of the apostle's inward life and outward labors than
we could otherwise gain. Without the epistles the biographical
notices of the Acts would be very incomplete; without the narrative
of the Acts many references in the epistles would remain
obscure.</p>
<p>Yet these same historic parallelisms, which are the source of so
much light, are the occasion of difficulties also, which require
for their adjustment a comprehensive view of the spirit of
inspiration. In respect to all essential matters of faith and
practice, a divine unity pervades the Holy Scriptures. But this
essential unity does not exclude diversity of conception and
representation. Though all the "holy men of God spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost," it pleased the divine Spirit to leave
them free to speak each in accordance with his individual
peculiarities of thought and language. A page from the writings of
the apostle John, taken anywhere at random, can be at once
distinguished from a page of Paul or Luke. In <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>{537}</span> relating
the same transaction, two inspired writers often select different
materials, or handle them in a different way. The narrative of each
is truthful, but not exhaustive. It gives a correct view of the
thing related, but not all the particulars connected with it. The
omission from two or more parallel narratives of concomitant
circumstances, or the neglect of exact chronological order,
sometimes makes the work of harmonizing them a very difficult
matter. We feel confident that each separate narrative is correct,
and that, had we all the accompanying circumstances in the true
order of time, we could see <i>how</i> they are consistent with
each other; but for want of this light the exact mode of
reconciliation remains doubtful. Such difficulties are incident to
all parallel histories. Had the Holy Spirit seen good, he could
have excluded them from the pages of inspiration; but herein he
chose to deal with us not as children, but rather as men "of full
age, even those who, by reason of use, have their senses exercised
to discern both good and evil." It is worthy of special notice,
that where two or more evangelists record the same words of our
Saviour, they are solicitous only about their substance.</p>
<p>In the three parallel accounts of the storm on the sea of
Galilee, the disciples say according to Matthew (8:25): "Lord save
us, we perish;" according to Mark (4:38): "Master, carest thou not
that we perish?" according to Luke (8:24): "Master, master, we
perish." And the Lord answers according to Matthew (v. 26): "Why
are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" according to Mark (v. 40):
"Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?" according
to Luke (v. 25): "Where is your faith?" On the variations in the
words of the disciples Augustine well remarks (and the same remarks
hold good of our Lord's answer): "The disciples have one and the
same meaning in thus awaking the Lord and desiring salvation. Nor
is it necessary to inquire which of these addresses, rather than
the others, contains the exact words spoken to him. For whether
they uttered one of the three, or other words which no one of the
evangelists has mentioned, which yet have the same force in respect
to the truth of the thought, what matters it?" Harmony of the
Gospels 2.24, quoted by Alford on Matth. 8:25.</p>
<p>On the relation of the books of Chronicles to those of Kings and
the difficulties connected with them, see Chap. 20, Nos. 21, 22. On
the relation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id=
"page538"></a>{538}</span> of the four gospels to each other, see
Chap. 29, Nos. 4-10. We cannot here go into particulars. It must
suffice to indicate the general principle by which the harmonist
must be guided.</p>
<p>6. The <i>external acquirements</i> necessary to constitute the
well-furnished expositor of God's word&mdash;the "scribe which is
instructed unto the kingdom of heaven"&mdash;have been already
briefly noticed. Chap. 33, No. 6. Not only are the Scriptures in
their original form locked up in dead languages which the
interpreter must thoroughly master, but they are, so to speak,
embedded in ancient history, chronology, and arch&aelig;ology.</p>
<p>Illustrations of this point are so numerous that the only
difficulty is in the selection. The servitude of the Israelites
under the Egyptians, their captivity in Babylon, their deliverance
under Cyrus, and their subsequent history till the time of our
Lord's advent, connect themselves immediately, as all know, with
the general history of the ancient heathen world. But there are
many illustrations of a more special character. The difficulty of
the position in which our Lord was placed by the ensnaring question
of the Pharisees and Herodians respecting the lawfulness of paying
tribute to C&aelig;sar, and the divine wisdom of his answer (Matt.
22:15-22: Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26) cannot be perfectly
understood without a knowledge, on the one hand, of the political
condition and feeling of the Jews as subjected to the dominion of
the Romans, which they thoroughly detested, and of which dominion
the tribute money daily reminded them; and, on the other, of the
hatred which both Pharisees and Herodians bore towards Christ, and
their anxiety to find a pretext for accusing him to the people or
before this same Roman government.</p>
<p>To apprehend the force of our Lord's argument from the
Pentateuch against the error of the Pharisees: "Have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the
God of the dead, but of the living" (Matt. 22:31, 32), we must
understand the <i>form</i> in which the Sadducees denied the
doctrine of the resurrection. They denied, namely, the existence of
spirits separated from bodies. Acts 23:8. To them, consequently,
the death of the body was the <i>annihilation</i> of the whole man,
which made the very idea of a future resurrection an absurdity. Our
Saviour showed from the writings of Moses, whose authority they
acknowledged, the error of their assumption that the spirit dies
with the body. Thus he demolished the ground on which their denial
of a future resurrection rested.</p>
<p>The psalmist says of those who hate Zion: "Let them be as the
grass <span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id=
"page539"></a>{539}</span> upon the house-tops, which withereth
before one plucketh it" (Eng. version, "before it groweth up"):
"wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth
sheaves his bosom." Psa. 129:6, 7. For the illustration of these
words we need a double reference, (1) to the oriental custom of
constructing flat roofs covered with earth, on which grass readily
springs up; (2) to the division of the year into two seasons, the
rainy and the dry, upon the commencement of which latter such grass
speedily withers. Another reference to the same oriental roofs we
have in the words of Solomon: "The contentions of a wife are a
continual dropping;" "a continual dropping in a very rainy day and
a contentious woman are alike" (chaps. 19:13; 27:15), where we are
to understand a continual <i>dropping through</i> of water from the
roof, which makes every thing within uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Our Lord's parable of the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1-13) requires
for its illustration a knowledge of the oriental customs connected
with marriage: the transaction recorded by Luke, where a woman came
behind Jesus as he reclined at the table, washed his feet with her
tears, and wiped them with her hair (Luke 7:37, 38), and the
position of John when at the last supper he leaned on Jesus' bosom
(John 13:23, 25), cannot be made intelligible without a knowledge
of the reclining posture in which meals were then taken: one
familiar only with the use of glass or earthen bottles cannot
comprehend the force of our Lord's maxim respecting the necessity
of putting new wine into new bottles (Matt. 9:17), till he is
informed that oriental bottles are made of leather. We might go on
multiplying illustrations indefinitely, but the above must suffice.
We may affirm, without fear of contradiction, that the study of the
Holy Scriptures has contributed more than all other causes to the
diffusion among the masses of the community of a knowledge of
ancient history and antiquities. To say that a congregation has a
thorough knowledge of the Bible is equivalent to affirming that it
has an enlarged acquaintance with the ancient world in its spirit
as well as in its outward institutions and forms.</p>
<p>7. That the interpreter may make a wise and effective use of all
the helps that have been enumerated, he needs especially that sound
and practical judgment which is called in ordinary discourse
<i>good sense</i>. Investigations respecting the meaning of terms,
inquiries concerning the scope, reasonings from the context, the
comparison of parallel passages, the use of ancient history,
chronology, and arch&aelig;ology&mdash;that any one or all of these
processes combined may lead to valuable results they must be under
the guidance of that sound judgment and practical tact by which the
interpreter is enabled to seize the true <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>{540}</span> meaning
of his author and unfold it with accuracy, or is at least kept from
far-fetched and fanciful expositions where the author's real sense
is involved in obscurity.</p>
<p>(1.) This quality of sound judgment will preserve the
interpreter from <i>inept</i> expositions for which a plausible
reason many be assigned.</p>
<p>Thus, when the Saviour says to Martha, who "was cumbered about
much serving:" "One thing is needful," these words have been
interpreted to mean <i>one dish</i>&mdash;not many and elaborate
preparations, but a single dish. A sound judgment rejects at once
this interpretation as below the dignity of the occasion, and not
in agreement with what immediately follows: "Mary hath chosen that
good part, which shall not be taken away from her." The one thing
needful is such a devotion of the soul to Christ as Mary
manifested. So the words: "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more
than these?" (John 21:15), have been explained to mean: more than
these <i>fish</i>, or the employment and furniture of a
fisherman&mdash;an ingenious substitution, one must say, of a low
and trivial meaning for the common interpretation: more than these
thy fellow-disciples love me, which accords so perfectly with
Peter's former profession: "Though all men shall be offended
because of thee, yet will I never be offended." Matt. 26:33; Mark
14:29.</p>
<p>Interpreters who ordinarily manifest sound judgment and skill
are sometimes betrayed into inept expositions through the influence
of some preconceived opinion. The psalmist says, for example (Psa.
17:15): "As for me, in righteousness shall I behold thy face: I
shall be satisfied upon awaking with thy likeness;" that is, with
the contemplation of thy likeness, with apparent reference to Numb.
12:8: "The likeness of the Lord shall he behold." This passage is
ordinarily interpreted correctly of the vision of God upon awaking
in the world to come. And this view is sustained by other like
passages: "In thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand
there are pleasures for evermore" (Psa. 16:11); "Truly God shall
redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; for he shall take me,"
(Psa. 49:15), where Tholuck well says: "He who took an Enoch and a
Moses to himself, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, will also
take me to himself;" "Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel, and
afterwards take me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee? and
there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. My flesh and
my heart faileth: God is the strength of my heart, and my portion
for ever" (Psa. 73:24-26)&mdash;words that are inexplicable except
as containing the anticipation of a blessed immortality with God in
heaven; "The wicked is driven away in his wickedness; but the
righteous hath hope in his death" (Prov. 14:32); <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>{541}</span> etc. But
there is a class of interpreters who, having adopted the maxim that
the Old Testament, at least in its earlier writings, contains no
anticipations of a blessed life with God after death, are
constrained to give to the passage in question the frigid meaning:
I shall be satisfied with thy likeness when I awake to-morrow, as
if the psalm were intended to be an evening song or prayer; or,
whenever I awake, that is, from natural sleep.</p>
<p>(2.) A sound judgment will also keep the biblical scholar from
interpretations that are <i>contrary to the known nature of the
subject</i>.</p>
<p>A familiar example is the declaration made by Moses of God's
view of man's wickedness: "And it repented the Lord that he had
made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart." Gen. 6:6.
The robust common sense of any plain reader will at once adjust the
interpretation of these words to God's known omniscience and
immutability; just as he will the prayer of the psalmist: "Search
me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts; and see
if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
everlasting." Psa. 139:23, 24. The immutable God does nothing which
is not in accordance with his eternal counsels. The omniscient God,
to whom all truth is ever present, does not literally institute a
process of searching that he may know what is in man. But in these
and numberless other passages, he condescends to speak according to
human modes of thought and action.</p>
<p>When it is said, again, that "the Lord hardened the heart of
Pharaoh;" that "God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the
men of Shechem" (Judg. 9:23); that he sent a lying spirit to
deceive Ahab through his prophets (1 Kings 22:21-23); that he sent
Isaiah with the command: "Make the heart of this people fat, and
make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes" (Isa. 6:10); that he
made the covenant people to err from his ways, and hardened their
heart from his fear (Isa. 63:17), we instinctively interpret these
and other like passages in harmony with the fundamental principle
announced by the apostle: "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am
tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth
he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his
own lust, and enticed." Jas. 1:13, 14. The Scriptures ascribe every
actual event to God in such a sense that it comes into the plan of
his universal providence; but they reject with abhorrence the idea
that he can excite wicked thoughts in men, or prompt them to wicked
deeds.</p>
<p>When it is said, once more, that men are <i>drawn</i> to Christ
(John 6:44), or <i>driven</i> to worship the heavenly bodies (Deut.
4:19), we understand at once a drawing and a driving that are in
accordance with their free intelligent and responsible nature.
Other illustrations of this principle will be <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>{542}</span> given in
the following chapter, which treats of the figurative language of
Scripture.</p>
<p>(3.) The same quality of good sense will enable the interpreter
to make those <i>limitations</i> in the language of the sacred
writers which are common in popular discourse. In the language of
daily life many statements are made in general terms that require
for their exact truthfulness various qualifications which the
readers or hearers can readily supply for themselves. Honest men,
addressing honest men, are not in the habit of guarding their words
against every possible misconstruction. It is enough if they speak
so that all who will can understand them.</p>
<p>It is said, for example (Gen. 41:57), that "all countries
(literally, <i>all the earth</i>) came into Egypt to Joseph for to
buy corn; because the famine was sore in all the earth." It would
be only trifling to ask whether "all the earth" included the people
of Europe and India. The reader naturally understands all the lands
around Egypt, since they only could come thither for corn. So when
it is said in the account of the deluge that "all the high hills
that were under the whole heaven were covered" (Gen. 7:19), it is
straining the sacred writer's words to give them a rigid
geographical application, as if they must needs include the
mountains about the North pole. "All the high hills under the whole
heaven" were those where man dwelt, and which were consequently
known to man. "The Holy Ghost," says John, "was not yet given,
because that Jesus was not yet glorified." John 7:39. Yet David
prayed ages before: "Take not thy Holy Spirit from me" (Psa.
51:11); Isaiah says of ancient Israel that "they rebelled and vexed
his Holy Spirit" (Isa. 63:10); the Saviour, long before his
glorification, promised the Holy Spirit to all that should ask for
him (Luke 11:13); and it is a fundamental article of our faith that
from Abel to the archangel's trump all holiness is the fruit of the
Spirit. But John's readers, who lived after the plenary gift of the
Holy Spirit from the day of Pentecost and onward, could not fail to
understand him as referring to the gift of the Spirit in that
special sense. The apostle Paul says (1 Tim. 2:4) that God "will
have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the
truth." Yet the same apostle teaches that some will remain in
ignorance of the truth, and thus perish. 2 Thess. 1: 8, 9; 2:11,
12. The reader's good sense readily reconciles the former with the
latter passages. He understands God's will to have all men saved as
the will of <i>benevolent desire</i>; just as God says of ancient
Israel (Psa. 81:13). "Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and
Israel had walked in my <span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id=
"page543"></a>{543}</span> ways!" but because they would not do
this, he "gave them up to their own heart's lust, and they walked
in their own counsels" (ver. 12). Many like illustrations might be
added.</p>
<p>(4.) Hence we readily infer the office of a sound judgment in
<i>reconciling apparent contradictions</i>, since these arise
mainly from the neglect, in one or both of the passages between
which the contradiction is said to exist, of reasonable
qualifications and limitations.</p>
<p>A striking illustration of this is found in the two accounts of
the creation. Gen. chaps. 1-2:3 and chap. 2:4-25. In the former
narrative the order of time is an essential element. Not so in the
latter, where man is the central object, and the different parts of
creation are mentioned only as the writer has occasion to speak of
them in connection with him. Hence we have in this latter passage
the creation of the man (ver. 7), the planting of the garden for
his use with its trees and rivers (ver. 8-14), the placing of the
man in the garden and the law imposed upon him (ver. 15-17), the
defective condition of the man (ver. 18), the notice in connection
with this of the creation of beasts and fowls and their being
brought to the man to receive names (ver. 19, 20), the creation of
the woman and the primitive condition of the pair (ver. 21-25).
This simple statement of the course of narration sufficiently
refutes the allegation that the second account is inconsistent with
the first.</p>
<p>In the first account of Paul's conversion it is said that "the
men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but
seeing no man." Acts 9:7. In the second Paul says: "They that were
with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not
the voice of him that spake to me." Acts 22:9. There is no valid
ground for doubting that the first narrative, as well as the other
two, came from the lips of the apostle himself, and the assumption
of any essential contradiction is unreasonable and unnecessary. In
regard to the <i>light</i>, it is certain that Paul saw the
<i>person</i> of the Saviour, and was made blind by the glory of
the vision (Acts 9:17, 27; 22:14; 1 Cor. 9:1), while his companions
saw only the light that shone around them, which did not make them
blind. In regard to the <i>voice</i>, it is a fair interpretation
that they heard a voice only, but no intelligible words. <i>How</i>
this difference of perception between Paul and his companions in
regard to both the light and the voice was effected we do not know,
nor is it necessary that we should. The first account, again,
represents Paul's companions as having "stood speechless," while in
the third the apostle says: "When we were all fallen to the earth,"
Acts 26:14. The most natural explanation here is that the third
narrative gives the posture with accuracy, while the first lays
stress only upon the amazement <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page544" id="page544"></a>{544}</span> which fixed them in a
motionless attitude. The apparent discrepancies in these three
parallel histories are peculiarly instructive, because they all
proceed from the pen of the same author, and must all have been
derived from the same source. Such circumstantial differences have
the stamp of reality. Instead of throwing any discredit upon the
transaction, they only establish its truth upon a firmer basis.
Many like illustrations might be added.</p>
<p>(5.) Finally, where the means of reconciling discrepancies are
not apparent, the same quality of a sound judgment will keep us
from the two extremes of <i>seeking</i>, on the one hand, <i>forced
and unnatural explanations</i>, and, on the other, of
<i>discrediting well-attested transactions</i> on account of these
discrepancies. In the scriptural narratives there are some
difficulties (relating mostly to numbers, dates, and the
chronological order of events) which we find ourselves unable, with
our present means of knowledge, to solve in a satisfactory way. It
is the part of sober reason to reserve these difficulties for
further light, not to set aside, in view of them, facts attested by
irrefragable proof.</p>
<p>Nothing in the evangelic record is more certain, for example,
than the fact of our Lord's resurrection. Yet to harmonize the four
accounts which we have of it in all their details is a work of
extreme difficulty. "Supposing us to be acquainted with every thing
said and done, in its order and exactness, we should doubtless be
able to reconcile, or account for, the present forms of the
narratives; but not having this key to the harmonizing of them,
attempts to do so in minute particulars carry no certainty with
them." Alford on Matt. 28:1-10. The same general principle applies
to other difficulties&mdash;in the Old Testament, that respecting
the duration of the sojourn in Egypt, and other chronological
questions; in the New, that of the two genealogies given of our
Lord by Matthew and Luke, that of the day when our Lord ate the
passover with his disciples, etc. See further in Chaps. 19, Nos. 6
and 8; 20, No. 22; 29, Nos. 8-10.</p>
<p>8. In bringing this chapter to a conclusion, we add a few words
on <i>the office of reason</i> in the interpretation of Scripture.
It is admitted by all that we have certain primitive intuitions
which lie at the foundation of all knowledge. That an immutable
obligation, for example, rests on all men to be truthful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page545" id=
"page545"></a>{545}</span> just, benevolent, and grateful, is a
truth which we see by the direct light of conscience. There are
certain moral axioms, also, outside of the direct sphere of
conscience, which shine by their own light. Such is that
fundamental truth of theology thus announced by the apostle John:
"God is light, and in him is no darkness at all" (1 John 1:5);
where light and darkness are both taken in a moral sense, as the
context shows; and thus by the apostle James: "God cannot be
tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man" (Jas. 1:13); and
thus, ages before, by Moses: "He is the Rock, his work is perfect:
for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity,
just and right is he" (Deut. 32:4); and still earlier by Abraham:
"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (Gen. 18:25). We
are sure that no declaration of God's word, properly interpreted,
will contradict these necessary and universal convictions. But
there are many weighty truths that lie wholly above the sphere of
our direct intuitions on which the infinite understanding of God is
alone competent to pass an infallible judgment. Such are the
following: If it be God's will to create a race of intelligent
beings, what shall be the compass of their faculties, moral,
intellectual, and physical? In what circumstances and relations
shall he place them, to what probation shall he subject them, and
what scope shall he allow to their finite freedom? If they sin,
what plan shall he devise for their redemption, and by what
processes shall he reveal and execute this plan? These, and many
other questions involving man's highest interests, lie above the
sphere of simple intuition. God alone, who looks through eternity
at a glance, can fully comprehend them, for they are all
constituent parts of his eternal plan. That human reason, which
cannot see the whole of truth, should affect to sit in judgment
upon them, and to pronounce authoritatively what God may, and what
he may not do, is the height of presumption and folly.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page546" id=
"page546"></a>{546}</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<h3>THE FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF SCRIPTURE.</h3>
<p>1. When the psalmist says: "The Lord God is a sun and shield"
(Psa. 84:11), he means that God is to all his creatures the source
of life and blessedness, and their almighty protector; but this
meaning he conveys <i>under the figure</i> of a sun and a shield.
When, again, the apostle James says that Moses is read in the
synagogues every Sabbath-day (Acts 15:21), he signifies the
writings of Moses under the figure of his name. In these examples
the figure lies in particular words. But it may be embodied in a
sentence, thus: "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks"
(Acts 26:14), where Saul's conduct in persecuting Christ's
disciples is represented under the form of an ox kicking against
the ploughman's goad only to make the wounds it inflicts deeper.
Figurative language, then, is that in which <i>one thing is said
under the form or figure of another thing</i>. In the case of
allegories and parables, it may take the form, as we shall
hereafter see, of continuous discourse.</p>
<p>A large proportion of the words in all languages, in truth all
that express intellectual and moral ideas, were originally
figurative, the universal law being to represent immaterial by
material objects. Examples are the words <i>exist</i>,
<i>existence</i>, <i>emotion</i>, <i>affliction</i>,
<i>anguish</i>, etc. But in these, and innumerable other words, the
primitive physical meaning has become obsolete, and thus the
secondary spiritual meaning is to us literal. Or, what often
happens, while the original physical signification is retained, a
secondary figurative meaning of the word has become so common that
its use hardly recalls the physical meaning, and it may therefore
be regarded as literal; as in the words <i>hard</i>, <i>harsh</i>,
<i>rough</i>, when applied to character. In the first of the above
examples: "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks," the
transfer of the word <i>hard</i> from what is physically hard to
what is painful or difficult, is so common that it can hardly be
regarded as figurative. But the expression that follows is
figurative in the fullest sense of the word.</p>
<p>Rhetoricians divide figures into two general classes, figures of
<i>words</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id=
"page547"></a>{547}</span> and figures of <i>thought</i>, and they
give elaborate definitions, classifications, and rules for their
use. The interpreter of Scripture, however, need not encumber
himself with any rhetorical system. The general rules of
interpretation already considered will be, for the most part, a
sufficient guide to the meaning of the rich variety of figures
contained in the Bible, especially in its poetical parts. It is
only necessary to add a few words in reference to the ascertaining
of figurative language; the most prominent classes of figures; and
some principles to be observed in their interpretation.</p>
<p>2. The question may arise whether a writer is to be understood
literally or figuratively. For the <i>ascertaining</i> of
figurative language, a few simple rules will be, in general,
sufficient.</p>
<p>(1.) Multitudes of cases can be decided at once by considering
<i>the nature of the subject</i>.</p>
<p>Thus, when the apostle calls Jesus Christ a "foundation," and
speaks of building upon this foundation "gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble," adding that "every man's work shall be
revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what
sort it is;" and, further, that "if any man's work abide" this
fire, "he shall receive a reward," but "if any man's work be burned
he shall suffer loss" (1 Cor. 3:11-15), we know at once, from the
nature of the subject, that he speaks figuratively. He compares the
church of God to a temple, of which Jesus Christ is the foundation,
while her teachers and preachers are the builders. The "gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble," represent primarily
the materials with which they build; that is, the character of
their doctrines and precepts, and secondarily, the character of
those whom they bring into the Christian fold. The "fire," again,
is the trial and judgment of the last day.</p>
<p>The apostle says of the ancient Israelites that "they drank of
that spiritual Rock that followed them; and that Rock was Christ."
1 Cor. 10:4. So also Christ is called to believers "a chief
corner-stone, elect, precious;" but to unbelievers "a stone of
stumbling and a rock of offence" (1 Pet. 2:6-8); "the Lion of the
tribe of Judah, the Root of David" (Rev. 5:5); "the Lamb of God"
and simply "the Lamb" (John 1:29, 36; Rev. 5:12; 6:1; etc.); "the
door of the sheep" (John 10:7, 9); "the true vine" (John 15:1); and
"the living bread which came down from heaven" (John 6:51). He
himself says: "Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath
eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day." John 6:54.
There is no more ground for understanding the last of these
passages literally than the preceding, that is, there is no ground
whatever. The dogma of the Romish church, which teaches that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id=
"page548"></a>{548}</span> the consecrated bread and wine are
literally converted into the body and blood of Jesus, violates
alike sound reason and every sound principle of interpretation. "As
the words, 'This is my body,' and 'This is my blood,' were spoken
<span class="smcap">before</span> Christ's body was broken upon the
cross, and <span class="smcap">before</span> his blood was shed, he
could not pronounce them with the intention that they should be
taken and interpreted literally by his disciples. He could not take
his body in his hands, nor offer them his blood in the cup; for it
had not yet been shed." Horne, vol. 2, p. 319.</p>
<p>(2.) In ascertaining figurative language, the interpreter will
naturally take into account <i>the scope</i>, <i>the context</i>,
and the <i>general analogy of scriptural teaching</i>. If the
literal sense, though possible in the nature of things, is inept or
contrary to the general tenor of Scripture, it must be
rejected.</p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah tells us that, under the future reign of the
Messiah, the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard lie down
with the kid, the lion eat straw like the ox, and the child play
with impunity on the hole of the asp. Isa. 11:6-8. It is possible
to conceive of this state of things as effected by a change in the
physical nature of all noxious animals. But the writer immediately
adds: "They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for
the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
cover the sea" (ver. 9). Since then the change is effected by the
universal diffusion of "the knowledge of the Lord," it must be a
<i>moral</i> change&mdash;a transformation of the character of
wicked men figuratively described as wolves, leopards, bears,
lions, and vipers. The general analogy of prophetic language,
which, as will be hereafter shown, abounds in figurative forms of
representation, strengthens this conclusion.</p>
<p>By the prophet Haggai, again, God says: "Yet once, it is a
little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
sea, and the dry land." Chap. 2:6. The key to the meaning of these
words is given in the following verse: "And I will shake all
nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill
this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts." In such a
connection, and with such a result, nothing could be more vapid
than to understand this shaking of heaven and earth, sea and land,
in a physical sense. It is the mighty overturnings among the
nations, social, moral, and political, that are here predicted, as
Jehovah says by Ezekiel: "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it,
and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is, and I
will give it to him." Chap. 21:27. Compare Isa. 13:13; Jer. 4:24;
Ezek. 38:20; Joel 3:16. So when God announces that he "will cause
the sun to go down at noon, and darken the earth in the clear day"
(Amos 8:9), we understand at once that under this figure he
forewarns the covenant people of the sudden <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>{549}</span> approach
of great calamity. Compare Deut. 28:29; Job 5:14; Isa. 13:10; Jer.
4:23-28; Ezek. 32:7, 8; Joel 2:31; 3:15; etc. This subject will be
further discussed under the head of the interpretation of
prophecy.</p>
<p>In the sermon on the mount, the Saviour says: "Whosoever shall
smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also" (Matt.
5:39); but the preceding context gives the <i>scope</i> of this and
the other particular precepts that follow, which is that Christ's
followers should "resist not evil," that is, by rendering evil for
evil. It is the spirit of meekness and forbearance that he
inculcates, not a slavish regard to this and that particular form
of manifesting it. So when he says: "Give to him that asketh of
thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away"
(ver. 42), he cannot mean, consistently with the scope of the
passage and his teachings elsewhere, that we should stultify
ourselves by literally giving to every asker and borrower, without
regard to his necessities, real or alleged. He means rather to
inculcate that liberal spirit which never withholds such help as it
is able to give from those who need it.</p>
<p>When the Saviour says again: "If thy right eye offend thee,
pluck it out and cast it from thee," etc., both the preceding
context and the general tenor of the Scriptures teach us that he
means what is expressed by the apostle in another form: "Mortify,
therefore, your members which are upon the earth." Col. 3:5. To
<i>mortify</i> is to <i>deprive of life</i>, <i>make dead</i>. We
mortify our members which would seduce us into sin, not by
destroying them, but by keeping them in subjection to "the law of
the spirit of life in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p>(3.) If the interpreter is liable to err by taking figurative
language in a literal sense, so is he also by regarding as
figurative what should be understood literally. A favorite
expedient with those who deny the supernatural character of
revelation is to explain the miraculous transactions recorded in
the Bible as <i>figurative</i> or <i>mythical</i>. When David says
that in answer to his prayer "the earth shook and trembled, the
foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was
wroth;" that God "bowed the heavens also and came down, and
darkness was under his feet;" that "the Lord thundered in the
heavens, and the Highest gave his voice, hailstones and coals of
fire;" that "he sent out his arrows and scattered them, and he shot
out lightnings and discomfited them," all acknowledge that the
language is to be figuratively taken. Why then, an objector might
ask, not understand the account <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page550" id="page550"></a>{550}</span> of the giving of the law on
Sinai amid thunderings and lightnings as figurative also? The
answer of every plain reader would be&mdash;and it is the answer of
unsophisticated common sense&mdash;that the former passage occurs
in a lyric poem, where such figurative descriptions are entirely in
place; the latter in a plain narrative, which professes to give
throughout historic facts with names and dates; that no reader, who
had not a preconceived opinion to maintain, ever did or could think
of interpreting the passage in Exodus in any other than a literal
way, while every reader understands at once that the poetic
description in the eighteenth psalm is to be taken figuratively.
The attempt has been made to interpret the gospel history as a
<i>myth</i>&mdash;the embodiment of a system of pure ideas in the
garb of history. It is difficult to refute an assumption which has
no foundation to rest upon. This mythical theory may, nevertheless,
be disposed of in a very short and simple way. The great central
truth of the gospel history is the death and resurrection of Jesus
of Nazareth. If any one would know how the apostle Paul regarded
this, let him read the fifteenth chapter of the first epistle to
the Corinthians, where he pledges his veracity as a witness on its
historic reality (ver. 15). If, now, Paul so regarded it, Luke, his
companion in travel and labor, cannot have taken a different view
of it, nor any other of the evangelists. But if the death and
resurrection of Jesus are recorded as true historic events, the
whole mythical theory vanishes at once into thin air.</p>
<p>(4.) In regard to those prophecies which relate to the distant
future, it may sometimes be difficult to determine whether we are
to look for a literal or a figurative fulfilment of them. But this
subject will come up for consideration in another place.</p>
<p>3. In regard to the <i>different kinds of figures</i> a few
words may be in place.</p>
<p>(1.) The term <i>trope</i> (Greek, <i>tropos</i>, <i>a turn</i>)
is applied, in a general sense, to figures of words and speech of
every variety; but, in stricter usage, to a word or sentence
<i>turned</i> from its literal <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page551" id="page551"></a>{551}</span> signification to a
figurative sense. Quintilian adds (Inst. Orator. 8. 6. 1) that this
must be <i>with good effect</i> (<i>cum virtute</i>); that is, it
must add clearness, force, or beauty to the thought.</p>
<p>The principal varieties of the trope are the <i>metonymy</i> and
the <i>metaphor</i>. The <i>metonymy</i> is founded on the
<i>relation</i> of one thing to another. Thus when Abraham says to
the rich man: "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear
them" (Luke 16:29), Moses and the prophets are put for their
writings; that is, the <i>authors</i> for their <i>works</i>. "A
soft tongue," says the wise man, "breaketh the bone." Prov. 25:15.
Here the word tongue is put for speech, the <i>instrument</i> for
the <i>thing effected</i>, and this metonymy is joined with a
metaphor. (See below.) The <i>synecdoche</i>, in which a
<i>part</i> is put for the <i>whole</i>, as the <i>sword</i> for
<i>war</i>, is in its nature essentially a metonymy. Rhetoricians
give elaborate classifications of metonymies, but they are of
little value to the scriptural student, since all are interpreted
according to the few simple principles given in the preceding
chapter.</p>
<p>The <i>metaphor</i> is founded on the <i>resemblance</i> of one
thing to another; as in the examples already given: "The Lord God
is a sun and shield" (Psa. 84:11); "I am the true vine and my
Father is the husbandman." John 15:1. It may lie not in a single
word, but in an entire expression, thus: "It is hard for thee to
kick against the pricks" (Acts 26:14); "I counsel thee to buy of me
gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white
raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy
nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that
thou mayest see." Rev. 3:18. The metaphor and metonymy may be
joined, as in the words already quoted: "A soft tongue breaketh the
bone;" or they may blend themselves with each other, as when Nahum
says of the princes of Nineveh: "The sword shall devour thy young
lions." Chap. 2:13. In this last example, as often elsewhere,
<i>personification</i>, which is properly a figure of thought, is
added, the sword being represented as a beast of prey. The grand
and gorgeous personifications of Scripture naturally clothe
themselves in tropical language of inimitable beauty and
exhaustless variety. "O thou sword of the Lord," says Jeremiah,
"how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy
scabbard, rest, and be still. How can it be quiet, seeing the Lord
hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore?
There hath he appointed it." Chap. 47:6, 7. The prophet Habakkuk
represents God as coming forth in his glory for the salvation of
his people: "The mountains saw thee," says he, "and they trembled:
the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice,
and lifted up his hands on high: the sun and moon stood still in
their habitation." Chap. 3:10, 11. God's <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552"></a>{552}</span> promise
to his redeemed is: "Ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth
with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before
you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
hands." Isa. 55:12. Metonymies, metaphors, and sometimes
personifications&mdash;the books of the New Testament sparkle with
these figures, and they are used always for effect, not empty show.
They are like the flaming bolts of heaven, which rend and burn as
well as shine. "Beware of false prophets," says the Saviour, "which
come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits: do men gather grapes of
thorns or figs of thistles?" Matt. 7:15, 16. How effectually does
he by these metaphors strip off the mask from false teachers! "If
the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the
body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say,
Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not
of the body?" 1 Cor. 12:15, 16. Here is personification without a
trope. "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory?" (1 Cor. 15:55), here is a majestic personification in
metaphorical form.</p>
<p>As resemblance lies at the foundation of the metaphor, it may be
called an <i>abbreviated form of comparison</i>, the thing with
which the comparison is made being directly predicated of that
which is compared. Thus, when we say: A sluggard is vinegar to the
teeth and smoke to the eyes of those who send him, we have a
metaphor, the sluggard being directly called vinegar and smoke. But
if we say: "As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
<i>so is</i> the sluggard to them that send him" (Prov. 10:26), we
have a comparison, and the language ceases to be tropical. The
metaphor is thus a more vivid form of expression than the
comparison.</p>
<p>A common mode of comparison in the book of Proverbs is simply to
put together the object compared and the thing or things with which
it is compared, thus: "A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
and a rod for the fool's back" (chap. 26:3); that is, <i>As</i> a
whip is appropriate for, the horse, and a bridle for the ass,
<i>so</i> is a rod for the fool's back. Again, "Where there is no
wood the fire goeth out, and where there is no tale-bearer the
strife ceaseth" (Prov. 26:20); "Charcoal to live coals, and wood to
fire; and a man of strife to kindle strife" (Prov. 26: 21); "Silver
dross spread over an earthen sherd&mdash;burning lips [lips glowing
with professions of love] and a wicked heart" (Prov. 26: 23); in
all which cases our version has supplied particles of
comparison.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page553" id=
"page553"></a>{553}</span>
<p>(2.) An <i>allegory</i> is the <i>narrative of a spiritual
transaction under the figure of something lower and earthly</i>,
the lower transaction representing directly the higher. We have in
the eightieth Psalm an exquisite example of the allegory: "Thou
hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen
and planted it. Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it
to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered
with the shadow of it," etc. (ver. 8-16); where the transfer of the
Israelitish people from Egypt to the land of Canaan, with their
subsequent history, is described under the figure of a vine.</p>
<p>The metaphor and allegory have this in common, that the
foundation of both is <i>resemblance</i>, and in both the lower
object is <i>put directly</i> for the higher. Yet the metaphor
cannot be properly called a condensed allegory, nor the allegory an
extended metaphor; for it is essential to the allegory that it have
the form of a narrative, and that it contain real history&mdash;in
the case of <i>prophecy</i> it may be <i>future</i>
history&mdash;under a figure. Hence it admits of indefinite
extension, as in the "<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>;" and we may add
the <i>Canticles</i>, which the Christian church from the earliest
times has regarded as an allegory of which the subject is, in Old
Testament language, God and his covenant people, but, according to
the representation of the New Testament, Christ and his church.</p>
<p>We must carefully distinguish between <i>true allegory</i> and
the <i>allegorical</i> or <i>mystical application</i> of real
history. In the former case it is not the literal meaning, but the
higher sense represented by it, which constitutes the historic
truth. God, for example, never transferred a vine from Egypt to
Palestine, but he did the covenant people. The story of Sarai and
Hagar, on the contrary (Gen., chap. 16), is true history. The
apostle Paul makes an allegorical application of it to the two
covenants, that on Sinai and that in Christ, which is very
beautiful and appropriate; yet the story itself is not allegory,
but plain history. See further, in Chap. 37, No. 4.</p>
<p>(3.) A <i>parable</i> is the <i>narrative</i> of a supposed
event for the purpose of illustrating a <i>spiritual truth</i> or
principle. The office of the narrative is to embody the principle.
It should, therefore, be natural and probable; but its literal
truth is of no consequence. In our Lord's parable of the unjust
steward, for example (Luke 16:1-9), the incidents of the narrative
may or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page554" id=
"page554"></a>{554}</span> may not have been historically true; but
either way the great principle which it illustrates (ver. 10)
remains the same.</p>
<p>Allegories and parables pass into each other by insensible
degrees. Some of our Lord's so-called parables are rather
allegories; as that of the vineyard let out to husbandmen (Matt.
21:33-41), which is founded on the beautiful allegory of Isaiah
(chap. 5:1-7); so also that of the good shepherd (John 10:1-18). In
their pure form, however, the allegory and the parable are easily
distinguished from each other. In the allegory, the figure
represents directly the higher transaction. Hence the incidents
introduced in the figure&mdash;at least all the <i>main</i>
incidents&mdash;must have something corresponding to them in the
spiritual transaction which the figure represents. The case of the
parable is different. Here the spiritual truth is not directly
described in terms of the figure, but simply <i>illustrated</i>
from it. The incidents and characters of the story are separable
from the general principle which it inculcates, and are sometimes
formally separated by the speaker himself; as when our Lord says:
"The kingdom of heaven <i>is likened</i> unto a man which sowed
good seed in his field," etc. Matt. 13:24. For this reason they may
belong more or less to the mere drapery of the parable, so that to
press them in its interpretation would lead to error instead of
truth. See further below, No. 7.</p>
<p>(4.) <i>The fable</i> is related to the parable, but it differs
from it in two respects. <i>First</i>, it moves in a <i>worldly
sphere</i>, having to do with prudential maxims rather than
spiritual truth. <i>Secondly</i>, it allows, in harmony with this
its lower nature, irrational objects as speakers and actors, which
would be contrary to the dignity of the parable. Our Lord never
employed fables as vehicles of instruction. There are two examples
of them in the Old Testament; neither of them, however, coming from
the lips of prophetical men. The first is that of Jotham: "The
trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they
said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us," etc. Judg. 9:8-15.
The second is that of Jehoash: "The thistle that was in Lebanon
sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to
my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in
Lebanon, and trode down the thistle." 2 Kings 14:9.</p>
<p>(5.) A <i>symbol</i> is a <i>material object</i>, a
<i>transaction in the material world</i>, or sometimes a
<i>number</i>, to represent some <i>higher spiritual truth</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page555" id=
"page555"></a>{555}</span> Ritual symbols, like the ark of the
covenant, the high-priest's dress, the sacrifices, and, in general,
the whole tabernacle and temple service, will be considered
hereafter under the head of <i>types</i>. We speak of symbols now,
only so far as they belong to the human side of interpretation. We
have a beautiful example of a symbolic transaction in the
seventeenth chapter of the book of Numbers, where the princes of
Israel, by God's direction, take twelve rods, write each man his
name upon his rod, and lay them up in the tabernacle before the
Lord, whereupon Aaron's rod "budded, and brought forth buds, and
blossomed blossoms, and yielded almonds;" a symbol that God would
make the priesthood to flourish in his family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scriptural symbols exhibit a wonderful variety. Sometimes they
are seen in <i>dreams</i>, as in Jacob's dream of a ladder reaching
to heaven (Gen. 28:12-15); Pharaoh's two dreams of the fat and lean
kine, and the good and thin ears (Gen. 41:1-7); or in <i>prophetic
vision</i>, like Jeremiah's vision of a seething pot with the face
towards the north (Jer. 1:13); Ezekiel's vision of the cherubim
(chap. 1); and Amos' vision of a basket of summer fruit (chap.
8:2). At other times they are actual transactions. So the false
prophet Zedekiah "made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith
the Lord, with these shalt thou push the Syrians till thou have
consumed them" (1 Kings 22:11); the true prophet Jeremiah wore a
yoke upon his neck as a sign that God would subject the nations to
Nebuchadnezzar's power, and the false prophet Hananiah broke it,
that he might thus signify the deliverance of the people from
Nebuchadnezzar's rule. Jer. 27:1-8, compared with 28:10, 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(6.) A <i>proverb</i> is a <i>short maxim</i> relating to
practical life. It may be expressed literally or figuratively, but
in either case it must contain a <i>general truth</i>. "A scorner
loveth not one that reproveth him; neither will he go unto the
wise" (Prov. 15:12), is a proverb expressed in plain language. "The
name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it,
and is safe" (Prov. 18:10), is a proverb under a beautiful figure.
The foolish young men counselled Rehoboam to say to the Israelites:
"My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins." 1 Kings
12:10. This is not a proverb, because it contains <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page556" id="page556"></a>{556}</span> only the
figurative statement of a particular fact. But if we change the
form, and say: The little finger of a foolish ruler is thicker than
the loins of a wise king, we make it general, and thus it becomes a
proverb.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for a proverb (<i>mashal</i>) denotes a
<i>similitude</i>, this being one of its most common forms.
Examples occur in abundance in the book of Proverbs. We have them
in the form of <i>direct comparison</i>: "As in water face
answereth to face, so the heart of man to man" (chap. 27:19); "A
continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are
alike" (chap. 27:15); "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,
than a stalled ox and hatred therewith" (chap. 15:17). We have them
also in the form of <i>metaphor</i>: "The contentions of a wife are
a continual dropping" (chap. 19:13); "The lips of knowledge are a
precious jewel" (chap. 20:15). But most frequently the comparison
appears in the form of <i>contrast</i>, thus: "A wise son heareth
his father's instruction; but a scorner heareth not rebuke" (chap.
13:1); "A faithful witness will not lie; but a false witness will
utter lies" (chap. 14:5). The signification of the word
<i>proverb</i> is then extended to short sententious maxims of
every form, even where comparison is excluded, thus: "A wicked man
taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment"
(chap. 17:23).</p>
<p>(7.) The word <i>myth</i> (Greek <i>muthos</i>) was applied by
the Greeks to a legend or story of early times, then to a
<i>fable</i>, like those of &AElig;sop. In modern usage it is
defined to be a story in which "there is an unconscious blending of
the deeper meaning with the outward symbol, the two being separate
and separable in the parable." "The mythic narrative presents
itself not merely as the vehicle of the truth, but as itself being
the truth; while in the parable there is a perfect consciousness in
all minds of the distinctness between form and essence, shell and
kernel, the precious vessel and yet more precious wine that it
contains." Trench, Notes on the Parables, chap. 1. A good
illustration of this we have in the tales of Grecian mythology,
once received by the masses of the people as literally true; but
which "a later and more reflective age than that in which the
mythus had birth" learned to regard as only the vehicle of certain
ideas respecting deity. The myth, as thus defined, does not come
within the sphere of biblical interpretation. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557"></a>{557}</span> The
historic events recorded in the Old Testament may, and often do,
shadow forth something higher. In that case they are not myths, but
<i>typical history</i>. Chap. 37, No. 4. All the scriptural
narratives, on the contrary, which are true, not in their literal
meaning, but in a higher sense, come under the head of allegories,
parables, or symbolic representations.</p>
<p>4. In the <i>interpretation</i> of figurative language we must
be guided, in general, by the principles considered in the
preceding chapter. To lay down special rules for the interpretation
of the rich and endlessly varied figures which adorn the pages of
Holy Writ would be as impracticable as useless. The history of
Biblical exegesis, however, shows that some general cautions are
much needed.</p>
<p>5. The youthful student of Scripture should be reminded, first
of all, that its figurative language is no less <i>certain and
truthful</i> than its plain and literal declarations. The figures
of the Bible are employed not simply to please the imagination and
excite the feelings, but to teach <i>eternal verities</i>. The Lord
Jesus, "the faithful and true Witness," said: "Heaven and earth
shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away." Mark 13:31. Yet
there is a class of interpreters who seem to think that if they can
show in any given case that his language is figurative, its meaning
is well nigh divested of all certainty and reality. Thrice in
immediate succession did he solemnly warn his hearers to cut off an
offending hand or foot, and to pluck out an offending eye, rather
than be cast with the whole body into hell, "into the fire that
never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire
is not quenched." Mark 9:43-48. But, says one of this class of
expositors, the maiming of the body is figurative language, and so
is the representation of the worm that never dies. Undoubtedly the
maiming of the body is so; and how far the unquenchable fire may
also be a figure for the dread reality that awaits the incorrigibly
impenitent in the world to come we pretend not to know. But in the
lips of Jesus figures teach truth, not fiction. The unhappy sinner
who despises the grace of the gospel will find the reality not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id=
"page558"></a>{558}</span> less terrible than the figures by which
Christ has represented it. The story of the rich man and Lazarus is
a parable; but we cannot on this ground set aside the solemn
lessons which it inculcates. What these lessons are, it requires
only candor and faith to receive. They teach us that God's
suffering children go immediately, upon death, to a state of
conscious blessedness; and "the men of the world, which have their
portion in this life," to a place of unmitigated suffering.
Whatever be the comprehension of the word <i>Hades</i> (rendered in
our version by the word <i>hell</i>), there is an impassable gulf
between Lazarus in Abraham's bosom and the rich man in torment. The
"great gulf fixed" may be a figure; but it represents an awful
reality; and that reality is, that there is no transition from the
one state to the other.</p>
<p>6. In the <i>allegory</i> the higher spiritual transaction is,
as we have seen, directly represented by the lower. When we know,
therefore, what the allegory represents, we have the key to its
interpretation, and all its incidents fall naturally into place. If
the sphere of the allegory be the outward history of God's people,
all its incidents&mdash;at least all its <i>main</i>
incidents&mdash;ought to have a significance. If its sphere be that
of inward spiritual experience, as in the Song of Solomon, more
latitude must be allowed for the drapery of the story; yet here
also the essential parts will each correspond to something in the
higher object represented.</p>
<p>An example of pure historic allegory is that of the vine
transplanted from Egypt (Psa. 80), where the higher object, which
gives the key to the meaning, is <i>God's covenant people</i>. The
casting out of the heathen (ver. 8), is literally expressed, but in
the verses following, the figure is beautifully carried out. This
vine takes deep root and fills the land; the hills are covered with
its shadow, and its boughs are like the goodly cedar; it sends out
its boughs to the sea, and its branches to the river (ver. 9-11).
Here we have one main incident, the <i>increase</i> of the people
in the land of Canaan. Then God breaks down its hedges, so that
every passer-by plucks it; the boar out of the wood wastes it, and
the wild beast of the field devours it (ver. 12, 13). This is
another main incident, the <i>withdrawal of God's protection</i>
from his people, and their oppression by their heathen neighbors.
The prayer that follows in behalf of this vine (ver. 14-16)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page559" id=
"page559"></a>{559}</span> represents the <i>love</i> which God's
people bear to his church. All these parts of the allegory have
their proper significance. The rest of the imagery&mdash;the hills
overshadowed by it, the boughs like the goodly cedar, the wild boar
wasting it, etc.&mdash;is but the drapery of the allegory; and an
attempt to find a spiritual meaning for each of these
particulars&mdash;the boar out of the wood, for example, and the
beast of the field&mdash;would but mar its beauty and force.</p>
<p>We give from Ezekiel (chap. 17:3-10) another example of historic
allegory, in which the essential parts can be readily distinguished
from the luxuriant imagery of the prophet: "A great eagle with
great wings, long-winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors
[Nebuchadnezzar], came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of
the cedar [Jehoiachin, whom Nebuchadnezzar dethroned and carried to
Babylon. The cedar of Lebanon represents the royal family, and
Jehoiachin, as the reigning monarch, its highest branch]: he
cropped off the top of his young twigs [the same as: he took the
highest branch of the cedar], and carried it into a land of traffic
[Chaldea]; he set it in a city of merchants [Babylon]. He took also
of the seed of the land [the king's seed, meaning Zedekiah, whom
Nebuchadnezzar made king in the place of Jehoiachin], and planted
it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as
a willow-tree [established Zedekiah on the throne, and gave him the
means of prosperity as his vassal]. And it grew, and became a
spreading vine of low stature [not a lofty cedar, but a low vine;
that is, a tributary king], whose branches turned towards him
[towards Nebuchadnezzar, as dependent upon him], and the roots
thereof were under him [under Nebuchadnezzar, as subject to his
power]: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot
forth twigs. There was also another great eagle with great wings
and many feathers [Pharaoh, king of Egypt]: and behold this vine
did bend her roots towards him [Zedekiah turned away his confidence
from Nebuchadnezzar to Pharaoh], and shot forth her branches
towards him, that he might water it by the furrows of her
plantation. It was planted [had been planted by Nebuchadnezzar] in
a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches,
and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine
[fidelity to Nebuchadnezzar would have made Zedekiah prosperous].
Say thou, Thus saith the Lord God: Shall it prosper? [now that it
bends towards the second eagle] shall he [Nebuchadnezzar] not pull
up the roots thereof, that it wither? It shall wither in all the
leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to
pluck it up by the roots thereof [the work of plucking it up will
be easy, not requiring a numerous force]. Yea, behold, being
planted shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither when the east
wind toucheth it? [a new figure to represent its destruction] it
shall wither in the furrows where it grew."</p>
<p>There is a class of allegories in the Old Testament which
represent the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page560" id=
"page560"></a>{560}</span> relation of God to his people under the
figure of husband and wife. Such are the Song of Solomon, and the
two remarkable allegories in Ezekiel (chapters 16 and 23). The
luxuriant fulness of imagery in these allegories does not admit of
interpretation in detail. The general scope only of the images is
to be taken into account, since this contains the essential
idea.</p>
<p>In the free style of the scriptural writers the allegory admits
of the introduction of <i>literal</i> clauses ("<i>Thou hast cast
out the heathen</i>, and planted it," Psa. 80:8), and also of
<i>explanatory</i> clauses, though not so readily as the parable.
See examples in Isa. 5:7; John 10:9, 11, 14.</p>
<p>7. The scriptural <i>parables</i> have a rich variety of form,
sometimes approaching to that of the allegory, when the
interpretation must be upon the same general principle. In its pure
form, however, the parable does not, like the allegory, represent
directly the higher spiritual truth, but is simply a narrative to
illustrate it. It may be introduced in the absolute form, like the
parable of the barren fig-tree (Luke 13:6-9); or, more commonly, in
the shape of a similitude, thus: "The kingdom of heaven is likened
unto a man which sowed good seed in his field" (Matt. 13:24);
"Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what
comparison shall we compare it?" Mark 4:30. It may be left without
explanation, but more commonly an explanatory remark is added. So
to the parable of the two sons whom the father asked to work in his
vineyard is added the application: "Verily I say unto you, that the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you"
(Matt. 21:28-31); and the parable of the Pharisee and publican is
both introduced and followed by an explanatory clause (Luke
18:9-14). All such clauses are of the highest importance for the
interpretation of the parables to which they are annexed. In the
interpretation of a parable, the first and most important thing is
to ascertain the spiritual truth which it is intended to inculcate.
How far a spiritual significance is to be sought for the particular
incidents of parables is a question to be determined separately for
each, according to its nature.</p>
<p>In the parable of the sower, which our Lord himself interpreted
(Matt. 13:3-8, 19-23), all the parts are essential, since the four
different kinds of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id=
"page561"></a>{561}</span> soil represent four different classes of
hearers. So in the parable of the tares in the field (Matt.
13:24-30, 37-43), the good seed sown by the owner of the field, the
tares sown by his enemy, the separation, at the time of harvest, of
the tares from the wheat, the burning of the tares, and the
gathering of the wheat into the barn, are all main incidents in its
spiritual application. Not so in the parable of the ten virgins
(Matt. 25:1-13), of which our Lord himself has given the scope,
and, so far as we can see the only scope: "Watch, therefore, for ye
know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh."
If we go farther, and inquire what is the spiritual meaning of the
lamps and oil-vessels, of the equal division of the virgins into
five wise and five foolish, of the request of the foolish virgins
that the wise would give them oil, and the answer of the wise
virgins, we run into useless speculations. All these particulars
belong to the drapery of the parable, and are intended to make the
story natural and probable.</p>
<p>In the pure form of the parable, the personages introduced to
illustrate God's ways of providence and grace do not, as in the
allegory, directly represent God himself. It is not necessary,
therefore, that there be in all cases a correspondence between
their character and that of the holy God. It is sufficient if the
words and deeds ascribed to them truly illustrate the spiritual
principle in question. In the parable of the unforgiving servant
(Matt. 18:23-35), his lord "commanded him to be sold, and his wife
and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made" (ver.
25); and afterwards he "was wroth, and delivered him to the
tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him" (ver.
34). We need not trouble ourselves about the reasonableness of
these acts <i>on the part of an earthly lord</i>. It is sufficient
for the end of the parable that they were in accordance with the
usages of the age, and thus illustrated the great truth which the
parable was intended to enforce: "So likewise shall my heavenly
Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every
one his brother their trespasses" (ver. 35). We have still more
forcible illustrations of this principle in such parables as those
of the importunate friend (Luke 11:5-8), the unjust judge (Luke
18:1-8), and the unfaithful steward (Luke 16:1-9). The Saviour does
not compare God to an indolent friend, who will not arise to
accommodate his neighbor with bread till he is forced to do so by
his importunity; nor to an unjust judge, who fears not God nor
regards men. But he <i>draws illustrations</i> from their conduct
of the efficacy of importunate prayer; adding, at the conclusion of
each parable, its scope: "And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be
given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you" (Luke 11:9); "And shall not God avenge his own elect,
which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?"
Luke 18:7. In the parable of the unfaithful steward, our Lord
introduces a fraudulent transaction&mdash;a transaction so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page562" id=
"page562"></a>{562}</span> manifestly fraudulent that there is no
danger of our thinking that it could have his
approbation&mdash;that he may thus illustrate the importance of
<i>prudent provision</i> for the future. By allowing each of his
lord's debtors to diminish the amount due from him, he gains their
favor, that in time of need he may be received into their houses.
For the right apprehension of the parable, the words of the eighth
verse are of primary importance: "And the lord [the master of the
steward] commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely"
[<i>prudently</i>, as the Greek word means]. Unjust as the
steward's conduct was, he could not but commend it as a prudent
transaction for the end which he had in view. Our Saviour adds:
"For the children of this world are in their generation [more
exactly, <i>towards</i> or <i>in respect to</i> their own
generation; that is, in dealing with men of their own sort] wiser
than the children of light." The steward and his lord's debtors
were all "children of this world," and the transaction between them
was conducted upon worldly principles. Our Saviour would have "the
children of light"&mdash;God's holy children, who live and act in
the sphere of heavenly light&mdash;provident of their everlasting
welfare in the use which they make of this world's goods, as this
steward was of his earthly welfare when he should be put out of his
stewardship. He accordingly adds, as the scope of the parable (ver.
9): "Make to yourselves friends of [by the right use of] the mammon
of unrighteousness [so called as being with unrighteous men the
great object of pursuit, and too commonly sought, moreover, by
unrighteous means]; that when ye fail [are discharged from your
stewardship by death], they may receive you [that is, the friends
whom ye have made by bestowing your earthly riches in deeds of love
and mercy] into everlasting habitations." Our Lord uses the words,
"they may receive you," in allusion to the steward's language:
"they may receive me into their houses." They do not receive us by
any right or authority of their own, for this belongs to Christ
alone; but they receive us in the sense that they bear witness
before the throne of Christ to our deeds of love and mercy, by
which is manifested the reality of our faith, and thus our title,
through grace, to everlasting habitations. Compare the remarkable
passage in Matt. 25:34-46, which furnishes a true key to the
present parable.</p>
<p>8. To determine whether a <i>symbol</i> is a <i>real transaction
or seen only in vision</i>, we must consider both its <i>nature</i>
and the <i>context</i>. When Ezekiel, at God's command, visits the
temple-court, digs in its wall, and sees the abominations practised
there (chap. 8), we know from his own words (ver. 3) that the whole
transaction was "in the visions of God." So also the remarkable
vision of dry bones. Chap. 37:1-14. But the symbolical action that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page563" id=
"page563"></a>{563}</span> follows&mdash;the joining of two sticks
into one&mdash;seems to be represented as real; for the people ask
concerning it: "Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these?"
(ver. 18), and the two sticks are in the prophet's hand "before
their eyes" (ver. 20). The nature of the symbolical transaction
recorded in Jer. 32:6-12&mdash;the purchase of Hanameel's
field&mdash;with the accompanying historical circumstances, shows
that it was real. From the nature of the vision of the chariot of
God, on the contrary, which Ezekiel saw (chap. 1:10), as well as
from the accompanying notices (chaps. 1:1; 8:1-4), we know that it
was represented to the prophet's inner sense, not seen with his
outward eyes. The moral character of the transactions recorded by
Hosea (chaps. 1-3) has led commentators to decide against their
literal occurrence.</p>
<p>In some cases we must remain in doubt whether the symbolical
transactions are real or seen in vision. How are we to understand,
for example, the transactions recorded in Isa. chap. 20; in Jer.
chap. 13:1-11; in Ezek. chap. 4? Concerning such examples
expositors will judge differently; but in either way of
understanding them, their meaning and the instructions which they
furnish are the same.</p>
<p>The subject of symbols will come up again in connection with
that of prophecy. At present we consider simply the general
principles upon which they are to be <i>interpreted</i>. Here we
are to be guided first of all by the writer's own explanations.
Where these are wanting we must carefully study the nature of the
figures used, and the connections in which they occur.</p>
<p>The sacred writers very commonly indicate the meaning of the
symbols which they employ. Thus the prophet Isaiah is directed to
loose the sackcloth from his loins, and put off his shoe from his
foot, walking naked and barefoot. Chap. 20:2. Then follows the
explanation of this symbolical transaction: "Like as my servant
Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and
wonder upon Egypt and Ethiopia; so shall the king of Assyria lead
away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young
and old, naked and barefoot," etc. (ver. 3, 4). For other examples
see the symbol of the girdle (Jer. 13:1-7 compared with ver. 8-11);
of the purchase of Hanameel's field (Jer. 32:6-12 compared with
ver. 13-15); of the removal of household stuff (Ezek. 12:3-7
compared <span class="pagenum"><a name="page564" id=
"page564"></a>{564}</span> with ver. 8-12); of the plumb-line (Amos
7:7, 8); of the four horns and four smiths (Zech. 1:18-21); and
many other symbolical transactions which will readily occur to the
student of Scripture.</p>
<p>But sometimes the symbol is given without an explanation, or
with only an obscure intimation of its meaning. The prophet Amos
has a vision of grasshoppers, and afterwards of a devouring fire,
with only a general intimation that they denote heavy calamities,
which the Lord in his pity will avert in answer to prayer. Amos
7:1-6. Here the nature of the symbols, in connection with the known
situation of the Israelitish people, shows that they represent the
general desolation of the land by foreign enemies. The prophet
Ezekiel adds no interpretation to his vision of the Lord enthroned
in glory upon the firmament above the chariot with four cherubim
and four living wheels full of eyes, in the midst of which a bright
fire glows and lightnings blaze. Chaps. 1, 10. From a careful study
of the nature of this magnificent imagery we may infer with
probability that the cherubim with their wheels, moving every way
with the rapidity of a flash of lightning, denote all the agencies
and instrumentalities by which God administers his government over
the world, which are absolutely at his command, and execute with
unerring certainty all his high purposes. The four faces of the
cherubim, moreover, which answer to the four principal divisions of
living beings among the Hebrews, seem to represent the fulness of
their endowments. The meaning of Ezekiel's vision of a New
Jerusalem, with its temple and altar, comes more properly under the
head of prophecy. Some of the symbols in the book of Zechariah are
expounded with beautiful clearness, as that of the two olive-trees.
Chap. 4:1-10. Of others the meaning is only hinted at in an
enigmatical way; so that their interpretation is a matter of great
difficulty and uncertainty. As examples we may refer to the symbol
of the ephah (chap. 5:5-11); of the four chariots coming out from
between two mountains of brass with horses of different colors
(chap. 6:1-9); of the two staves, Beauty and Bands, with which the
prophet in vision is commanded to feed "the flock of the
slaughter," and which he is afterwards to break (chap. 11:4-14).
For the details in the interpretation of these and other difficult
symbols the reader must be referred to the commentaries. Our limits
will only allow us to indicate the general principles upon which
the expositor must proceed.</p>
<p>9. There is a class of scriptural symbols which may be called
<i>numerical</i>. Thus <i>seven</i> is the well-known symbol of
completeness, <i>four</i> of universality, <i>twelve</i> of God's
people. See Chap. 32, No. 5. Under this head fall also those
passages in which a day is put for a year, or for an indefinitely
long period of time. One of the most certain examples is Daniel's
prophecy <span class="pagenum"><a name="page565" id=
"page565"></a>{565}</span> of the <i>seventy weeks</i> that were to
precede the death of the Messiah (chap. 9:24-27), for the details
of which the reader is referred to the commentators. Upon the same
principle we must, in all probability, interpret the "time and
times and dividing of time," that is, three and a half years (Dan.
7:25); the "forty and two months" (Rev. 11:2; 13:5); and the
"thousand two hundred and threescore days" (Rev. 11:3; 12:6).
Compare Ezekiel 4:4-8, in which symbolical transaction a day is
expressly put as the symbol of a year. On the symbolical
interpretation of the six days of creation, see in Chap. 19, No.
6.</p>

<h2>SECOND DIVISION.</h2>
<h3>INTERPRETATION VIEWED ON THE DIVINE SIDE</h3>
<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h3>THE UNITY OF REVELATION.</h3>
<p>1. "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
world;" and therefore they constitute together a self-consistent
whole. To receive the Holy Scriptures as containing a revelation
from God is to acknowledge that they possess an <i>essential and
all-pervading unity</i>. Whoever speaks timidly and hesitatingly of
the essential harmony between the Old Testament and the New, either
refuses to acknowledge both as given by inspiration of God, or he
apprehends this great fundamental truth only in a confused and
imperfect manner. If God spake by Moses and the prophets, as well
as by Christ and his apostles, it is vain to allege any
contradiction in doctrine or spirit between the former and the
latter. So absolutely certain is it that the Saviour and his
apostles built on the foundation of the Old Testament, that to deny
its divine authority is to deny that of the New Testament also.</p>
<p>2. But the unity of revelation, like that which pervades all the
other works of God, is a <i>unity in the midst of
diversity</i>&mdash;diversity in its contemporaneous parts, but
especially in its <i>progress</i>. Illustrations without number are
at hand. The history of a plant of wheat, from the time when the
kernel is sown in the earth to the harvest, has perfect unity of
plan. But how unlike in outward form are the tender blade, the
green stalk, and the ripened ear! The year constitutes a
self-consistent whole. But can any thing be more dissimilar in form
than <span class="pagenum"><a name="page567" id=
"page567"></a>{567}</span> spring and autumn? Yet no one thinks of
finding a want of harmony between the fragrant blossoms of the
former, and the ripened fruit of the latter. The path to the
harvest lies through the blossoms. Geologists dwell at great length
on the varied conditions through which our planet has passed, and
the wonderfully diversified forms of vegetable and animal life
corresponding to these several conditions. Yet in this endless
diversity of outward form they recognize from first to last a deep
underlying unity of plan. We might, then, reasonably infer
beforehand that if God should make a revelation of himself to men,
it would have not only unity but <i>diversity of outward form</i>,
especially <i>diversity of progress</i>. The fact that the
revelation contained in the Bible has such diversity is one of the
seals of its genuineness.</p>
<p>3. We may consider this unity in diversity in respect to the
<i>form of God's kingdom</i>. From Adam to Abraham God administered
the affairs of the human family as a whole, without any visible
organization of a church as distinct from the world at large. From
Abraham to Moses his church&mdash;using the term church in a
general sense&mdash;existed in a <i>patriarchal</i> form. With the
beginning of the Mosaic dispensation he put it into the form of a
<i>state</i>, of which he was the supreme head and lawgiver, while
its earthly rulers exercised under him all the functions of civil
offices, the bearing of the sword included. When Christ came, he
separated the church from the state, and gave it its present
spiritual and universal organization. In all this diversity of
outward form we recognize the progress of one grand self-consistent
plan.</p>
<p>4. We may now go back again to the beginning, and consider the
diversity in the <i>forms of public worship</i>&mdash;the simple
offering of Abel, who "brought of the firstlings of his flock, and
of the fat thereof," the altars of the patriarchs, the gorgeous
ceremonial of the Mosaic economy with its priesthood and
sacrifices, "the service of song in the house of the Lord" added by
David, the synagogue service of later times, and, finally, the
spiritual priesthood of believers under the New Testament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page568" id=
"page568"></a>{568}</span> whose office is "to offer up spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 2:5); and
show that through all this variety of outward form the essence of
God's service has ever remained unchanged, so that the example of
primitive believers is a model for our imitation. Heb. chap.
11.</p>
<p>5. We may show, again, that the same manifoldness belongs to
<i>the forms of labor</i> devolved on God's servants in different
ages. The work assigned to Noah was not that of Abraham; nor was
Abraham's work that of Moses; nor the work of Moses that of David;
nor David's work that of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; nor did any
one of the Old Testament believers receive the broad commission:
"Go ye into all the world; and preach the gospel to every
creature." They could not receive such a commission, for the way
was not yet prepared. Abraham must sojourn in the land of promise
"as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
Jacob" (Heb. 11:9); Moses must lead Israel out of Egypt, and be
God's mediator for the law given on Sinai; Joshua must take
possession of the land of promise and David maintain it, sword in
hand; the prophets must foretell the future glories of Christ's
kingdom, not preach it, as did the apostles, to all nations. But in
the divine plan this manifoldness of service constitutes a
self-consistent and harmonious whole.</p>
<p>6. The same unity in diversity belongs to <i>the spirit of
revelation</i>. Failing to apprehend the character of God in its
entireness, Marcion rent the seamless garment of divine perfection
into two parts, the one consisting of <i>justice</i>, which he
assigned to the "Demiurge" of the Old Testament, the other of
<i>goodness</i>, as the attribute of the supreme God of the New
Testament. He did not see that God's character is alike infinite on
both sides; that his justice is a justice of infinite goodness, and
his goodness a goodness of infinite justice. Hence he arrayed in
opposition to each other two caricatures of deity, the one drawn
from the Old Testament, the other from the New; an error in which
he has had too many imitators in modern times. To see the harmony
of the spirit that pervades the Holy Scriptures <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page569" id="page569"></a>{569}</span> from
beginning to end <i>in respect to the Divine character</i>, we
should take a comprehensive instead of a partial view of their
representations. It is true that the Old Testament describes God as
infinite in holiness and inflexibly just. But it also describes him
as "the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and
abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin." It is true that
God's covenant under the Old Testament was restricted to a single
nation; but this was, as has been heretofore shown,
<i>preparatory</i> to a universal dispensation of mercy, as when a
general seizes one strong position with a view to the conquest of
an entire region. Chap. 18. It is true, on the other hand, that the
New Testament is, in a peculiar sense, a revelation of God's mercy
through Jesus Christ. But it is a discriminating mercy, through
which God's awful holiness and justice shine with dazzling
brightness. It is a mercy shown not at the expense of justice, but
in perfect harmony with it; a mercy sternly restricted, moreover,
to those who comply with the conditions on which it is offered. The
gospel is a plan of salvation, not of condemnation; "for God sent
not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world
through him might be saved." John 3:17. Yet it brings condemnation
to those who reject it; for the Saviour immediately adds (ver. 18):
"He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name
of the only begotten Son of God." It is in the New Testament, not
in the Old, that we find the most awful declarations of God's wrath
against the finally impenitent, some of them proceeding, too, from
the lips of the compassionate Saviour: "The Lord Jesus shall be
revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire,
taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with
everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
glory of his power" (2 Thess. 1:7, 9); "He that believeth not the
Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page570" id="page570"></a>{570}</span> abideth
on him" (John 3:36); "These shall go away into everlasting
punishment, but the righteous into life eternal" (Matt. 25:46).</p>
<p>7. The same harmony of spirit pervades both Testaments in
respect to <i>the way of salvation</i>. On this momentous question
the teachings of the New Testament are fuller than those of the
Old, but never in contradiction with them. The Old Testament
teaches that men are saved, not from the merit of their good works,
but from God's mercy: the New Testament adds a glorious revelation
respecting the <i>ground</i> of this mercy in Jesus Christ. To
exhibit in a clear light the reality of this harmony, let us take a
passage of the New Testament which embodies in itself the substance
of the way of salvation, and compare with it the declarations of
the Old Testament. The following will be appropriate: "Not by works
of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost." Titus 3:5.</p>
<p><i>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to his mercy he saved us</i>. "The Lord did not set his
love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than
any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: but because the
Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had
sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a
mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the
hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt" (Deut. 7:7, 8); "For thy name's
sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great" (Psa. 25:11);
"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness;
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions" (Psa. 51:1); "I do not this for your sakes, O house
of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned
among the heathen whither ye went" (Ezek. 36:22); "We do not
present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but
for thy great mercies" (Dan. 9:18).</p>
<p><i>By the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost.</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page571" id=
"page571"></a>{571}</span> "Behold thou desirest truth in the
inward parts; and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know
wisdom. Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean; wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow." "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and
renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence;
and take not thy Holy Spirit from me" (Psa. 51:6, 7, 10, 11); "I
will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their
hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people" (Jer.
31:33); "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I
cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit
will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of
your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my
Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye
shall keep my judgments, and do them" (Ezek. 36:25-27).</p>
<p>8. The stern character of the Mosaic dispensation is freely
admitted. As a preparatory dispensation, severity belonged
appropriately to it. "The law," says Paul, "was our schoolmaster to
bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith." Gal.
3:24. Its office was to educate the human conscience to such a
point that it should be prepared for the full revelation of God's
mercy in Christ. We may concede the prominence of God's justice in
the Old Testament, and his mercy in the New; but we must never
forget that neither part of divine revelation is complete in
itself. It is only when we view them in their connection with each
other, as parts of one great whole, that we discern in them an
all-pervading unity and harmony of spirit.</p>
<p>From the unity of revelation some inferences may be drawn of a
very practical character, especially in reference to the
interpretation of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>9. <i>Each particular communication from God to man must be, in
its place and measure, perfect.</i> For it proceeded from the
infinite <span class="pagenum"><a name="page572" id=
"page572"></a>{572}</span> mind of God, who understood at the
beginning the whole plan of redemption, and who, when he made the
first revelation concerning it, knew all that was afterwards to
follow, and said and did, in the most perfect way, what was proper
to be said and done at the time. The revelations of the Holy
Spirit, therefore, admit of a stupendous <i>development</i>, but no
rectification or improvement. The very earliest of them contain the
germs of all that is to follow without any admixture of falsehood.
There is a holding back of the full light reserved for future ages,
but no mist of error&mdash;nothing which, fairly interpreted, will
ever need to be retracted. For this reason the very earliest of
God's communications to men retain for us, who live in these latter
days, their pristine freshness and power. Take, for example, the
great primitive prophecy: "I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise his heel." Gen. 3:15. We can find no words
more pertinent to describe the mighty conflict now going on between
the kingdom of God and that of Satan. What are they but a
condensation into one sentence of the history of redemption&mdash;a
flash of light from the third heavens, which discloses at a glance
man's destiny from Eden to the trump of the archangel? And so is it
also with the later prophecies concerning Christ and his kingdom.
What is true of the revelations of the Old Testament holds good of
all its <i>institutions</i>. In their place, and with reference to
the end which they proposed to accomplish, they were all perfect;
were the best that could be given under existing circumstances. At
the foundation of all our reasonings concerning the appointments of
the Old Testament must lie the axiom: "As for God his way is
perfect."</p>
<p>10. <i>The later revelations must he taken as the true exponents
of the earlier.</i> This is but saying that the Holy Spirit is the
true and proper expositor of his own communications to men. Since,
as we have seen, the first revelations were made in full view of
all that was to follow, the later revelations must be considered
not as a mass of foreign and heterogeneous materials <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page573" id="page573"></a>{573}</span>
superadded to the original prophecies, but as a true expansion of
the earlier prophecies out of their own proper substance. For
example, the promise made to Abraham: "In thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed" (Gen. 22:18), is not so much a new
promise as a further unfolding of the original one: "It shall
bruise thy head." A further development of the same promise we have
in Nathan's words to David: "Thine house and thy kingdom shall be
established for ever before thee, thy throne shall be established
for ever;" and in all the bright train of prophecies in which the
glory and universal dominion of the Messiah's kingdom are foretold
down to the day of Gabriel's announcement to Mary: "He shall be
great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God
shall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he shall
reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there
shall be no end." Luke 1:32, 33.</p>
<p>And since the manifestation of God in the flesh is the
culminating point of revelation, it follows that the Lord Jesus and
his apostles, whom he authoritatively commissioned to unfold the
doctrines of the gospel, must be, in a special sense, the
expositors of the Old Testament, from whose interpretations, when
once fairly ascertained, there is no appeal. The attempt of some to
make a distinction between Christ's authority and that of his
apostles is nugatory. As it is certain that our Lord himself could
not have been in error, so it is certain also that he would not
have commanded his apostles to teach all nations concerning himself
and his doctrines, and have further given them, in the possession
of miraculous powers, the broad seal of their commission, only to
leave them subject to the common prejudices and errors of their
age. See further in Chap. 7, Nos. 3, 4.</p>
<p>11. <i>The extent of meaning contained in a given revelation
must be that which the Holy Spirit intended.</i> It is not to be
limited, then, by the apprehension of those to whom it was
originally made. Earlier prophecy is, at least in many cases,
framed with a view to the subsequent development of its meaning.
Until <span class="pagenum"><a name="page574" id=
"page574"></a>{574}</span> such development is made by God himself,
either in the way of further revelations, or indirectly by the
course of his providence, men's apprehension of its meaning, though
it may be true as far as it goes, must yet be inadequate. To cite a
single passage from one of the Old Testament prophecies: "It hath
pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou
shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he
shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
in his hand." Isa. 53:10. No one will maintain that the Jews before
our Lord's advent (all carnal prejudices aside) could have had that
apprehension of its deep meaning which it is our privilege to
enjoy. This meaning was contained in the promise from the first,
but in an undeveloped form. Accordingly the prophets themselves
"inquired and searched diligently" concerning the import of their
utterances and the time of their fulfilment. 1 Pet. 1:11. They who
deny the reality of prophetic inspiration are necessitated, for
consistency's sake, to deny also the principle now laid down. But
if revelation be a true communication from God to men, it is
reasonable to believe that it should have contained from the
beginning the germs of mighty events in the distant future, the
realization of which in history should be, in connection with
further revelations from God, its true expositor.</p>
<p>12. <i>The more obscure declarations of Scripture are to be
interpreted from the clearer.</i> A single passage of God's word
occasionally gives us a glimpse of some great truth nowhere else
referred to in Scripture. Of this we have a remarkable example in
what the apostle says of Christ's delivering up the kingdom to the
Father upon the completion of the work of redemption. 1 Cor.
15:24-28. But no great truth relating to the way of salvation
through Christ is thus taught obscurely and in some single passage
of Scripture. Every such truth pervades the broad current of
revelation, and shines forth from its pages so clearly that no
candid inquirer can fail to apprehend its true meaning. If, then,
we find in the Bible dark and difficult passages, they must, if
interpreted at all, be explained, not <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page575" id="page575"></a>{575}</span> in
contradiction with what is clearly and fully taught, but in harmony
with it. This is but saying that, instead of using what is obscure
to darken what is clearly revealed, we should, as far as possible,
illustrate that which is dark by that which is clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Scriptures teach, for example, with abundant clearness, that
Christ is the only foundation on which the church can rest. Isa.
28:16; 1 Cor. 3:11; Ephes. 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:6. This is, indeed, an
office which plainly requires for its exercise that omnipotence,
and that supreme power in heaven and earth which are expressly
ascribed to him. Matt. 11:27; 28:18; John 5:19-30; 17:2; 1 Cor. 15;
24-28; Ephes. 1:20-23; Phil. 2:9-11; Col. 1:15-19; Heb. 1:3. When,
therefore, our Lord says to Peter: "Thou art Peter [that is, as the
word Peter means in the original, <i>Thou art Rock</i>], and upon
this rock will I build my church" (Matt. 16:18), to understand
Peter, or any pretended successor of Peter, as a rock in any other
sense than as an eminent instrument in Christ's hand for the
establishment of his church, is absurd and blasphemous.</p>
<p>Again: Christ gives to Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
with power to bind and loose (Matt. 16:19), and elsewhere the same
power is conferred upon all the apostles (Matt. 18:18). That Peter
and his associates in the apostleship had the keys of the kingdom
of heaven in any such sense as that in which Christ has them (Rev.
3:7); that is, that they had authoritative power to admit their
fellow-sinners to heaven, or exclude them from heaven, is contrary
to the whole tenor of the New Testament, which everywhere
represents Christ as the supreme Judge, upon whose decision depends
the everlasting destiny of every child of Adam. Matt. 7:21, 22;
16:27; 25:31-46; John 17:2; Acts 17:31; 2 Cor. 5:10. Christ's words
concerning the keys may be best understood of the <i>special</i>
authority which he bestowed on the apostles, as inspired teachers
and guides of his primitive church, to settle all questions
respecting her. For eminent examples of the exercise of this power,
see the decisions concerning Gentile converts, Acts 11:1-18;
15:1-29. In this sense the gift of the keys ceased with that of
inspiration. But if, as some think, the words may be understood of
the <i>common</i> power conferred by Christ on his churches to
regulate their own affairs, to administer discipline, and to admit
or exclude from their communion, the power continues in this sense
in the visible church, and is valid so far as it is exercised in
accordance with God's word.</p>
<p>So also must we interpret the words of Christ recorded by the
apostle John: "And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and
said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whosesoever sins ye
remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain,
they are retained." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id=
"page576"></a>{576}</span> Chap. 20:22, 23. The authoritative
forgiveness of sin is a prerogative of God alone, the exercise of
which implies omniscience as well as supreme authority in heaven
and earth. The prerogative of remitting and retaining men's sins
here conferred on the apostles is part of the general power of
binding and loosing already considered. It was exercised <i>in the
sphere of the visible church on earth</i>. As it respects the
actual forgiveness of sin and consequent admission of the soul to
communion with God here and eternal life hereafter, God's ministers
can only declare the terms of salvation as they are set forth in
the gospel.</p>
<p>The same general principle is applicable to the interpretation
of all passages containing "things hard to be understood." The
"unlearned and unstable" wrest them, by taking them out of their
connection and in contradiction to the general tenor of God's word.
But the candid student of Scripture never uses that which is
difficult in revelation to obscure that which is plain. He seeks,
on the contrary, to illumine what is dark by that which shines with
a clear and steady light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13. As a fitting close to this part of our subject we add some
remarks on <i>the analogy of faith</i>. "We may define it to be
that general rule of doctrine which is deduced, not from two or
three parallel passages, but from the harmony of all parts of
Scripture in the fundamental points of faith and practice." Horne's
Introduct., vol. 1. p. 269, edit. 1860. It is based on two
fundamental principles; first, that "all Scripture is given by
inspiration of God," and therefore constitutes a self-consistent
whole, no part of which may be interpreted in contradiction with
the rest; secondly, that the truths to which God's word gives the
greatest prominence, and which it inculcates in the greatest
variety of forms, must be those of primary importance. Thus
understood, the analogy of faith is a sure guide to the meaning of
the inspired volume. He who follows it will diligently and
prayerfully study <i>the whole word of God</i>, not certain
selected parts of it; since it is from the whole Bible that we
gather the system of divine revelation in its fulness and just
proportions. "If we come to the Scriptures with any preconceived
opinions, and are more desirous to put that sense upon the text
which coincides with our sentiments rather than with the truth, it
then becomes the analogy of <i>our</i> faith rather than that of
the whole system." Horne, <i>ubi supra</i>. In this substitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id=
"page577"></a>{577}</span> of "the analogy of <i>our</i> faith" for
the analogy of Scripture lies the foundation of sectarian
controversy.</p>
<p>Again; he who follows the true analogy of faith will not allow a
doctrine which runs through the whole tenor of divine revelation to
be weakened or set aside in the interest of some other scriptural
doctrine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Scriptures teach, for example, with great frequency and
clearness that men are saved, not from the merit of their good
works, but solely by God's free grace through faith in Jesus
Christ. They teach also with equal frequency and clearness that
without repentance and obedience to the divine law there is no
salvation. These two deductions are not contradictory, but
supplementary to each other. They present two sides of one and the
same way of salvation. Yet it may happen that a Biblical student
will find himself unable to reconcile in a logical way two such
deductions as the following: "Therefore we conclude that a man is
justified by faith without the deeds of the law" (Rom. 3:28); "Not
every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is
in heaven" (Matt. 7:21). What then shall we counsel him to do?
Plainly it is his duty, first of all, to receive and hold
<i>both</i> doctrines. <i>Afterwards</i> he may properly seek to
reconcile them with each other in a logical way; but if he fails to
accomplish this task to his satisfaction, he must not deny one
truth, or sink its importance, in the interest of the other. The
same general principle applies to various other doctrinal
difficulties, which need not be here specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, a true regard to the analogy of faith will make our
system of belief and practice <i>entire and well proportioned</i>
in all its parts. Every declaration of God's word is to be received
in a reverent and obedient spirit. But inasmuch as the Scriptures
insist much more earnestly and fully on some things than on others,
it is our wisdom to follow, in this respect, the leadings of the
Holy Spirit. It will be the aim of the enlightened believer to give
to each doctrine and precept of revelation the place and prominence
assigned to it in the Bible. Especially will he be careful that no
obscure or doubtful passage of Scripture be allowed to contradict
the plain teachings of inspiration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The practical study of the Bible, that is, the study of it as
"profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness," resolves itself in a great measure
into the comparison of Scripture with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page578" id="page578"></a>{578}</span>
Scripture, especially the comparison of <i>doctrinal
parallelisms</i>. All that the Bible teaches from Genesis to
Revelation concerning God's being and attributes, his providential
government over man, the person and offices of Christ and the way
of salvation through him, and the final destiny of the righteous
and the wicked, should be diligently compared, that from the whole
we may gather a full and well-proportioned system of faith and
practice as it is contained in the pages of inspiration. So far as
we fail to do this our view of divine truth is defective and
disproportioned. The solemn warning in respect to the last book of
revelation applies with equal force to revelation as a whole: "If
any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take
away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take
away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city,
and from the things that are written in this book." Rev. 22:18,
19.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<h3>SCRIPTURAL TYPES.</h3>
<p>1. The <i>material world</i> is full of <i>analogies</i> adapted
to the illustration of spiritual things. No teacher ever drew from
this inexhaustible storehouse such a rich variety of examples as
our Saviour. His disciples are the salt of the earth, the light of
the world, and a city set on a hill. From the ravens which God
feeds and the lilies which God clothes, he teaches the
unreasonableness of worldly anxiety. The kingdom of heaven is like
seed sown in different soils, like a field of wheat and tares
growing together, and like seed that springs up and grows the sower
knows not how. Again it is like a net cast into the sea, like a
grain of mustard seed, and like leaven hid in three measures of
meal. When the Saviour opens his lips the whole world of nature
stands ready to furnish him with arguments and illustrations; as
well it may, since the God of nature is also the God of revelation.
<i>The world of secular activity</i> abounds in like analogies, on
which another class of our Lord's parables is based; like that of
the vineyard let out to husbandmen, the servants intrusted with
different talents, the ten virgins, the importunate friend, the
unjust judge, the unfaithful steward, the prodigal son, and others
that need not be enumerated. Analogies like these, however, do not
properly constitute <i>types</i>. Types rest on a foundation of
analogy, but do not consist in analogy alone.</p>
<p>2. In the history of God's people, moreover, as well as of the
world which he governs with reference to them, the <i>present</i>
is continually foreshadowing <i>something higher in the future</i>.
This must be so, because the train of events in their history
constitutes, in the plan of God, neither a loose and disconnected
series nor a confused jumble of incidents, like a heap of stones
thrown together without order or design, but a well-ordered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page580" id=
"page580"></a>{580}</span> whole. It is a building, in which the
parts now in progress indicate what is to follow. It is the
development of a plant, in which "the blade" foreshadows "the ear,"
and the ear, "the full corn in the ear." The primal murder, when
"Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him," "because his
own works were evil and his brother's righteous," was the
inauguration of the great conflict between the seed of the woman
and the seed of the serpent&mdash;the forerunner of the higher
struggle in Egypt between Pharaoh on the side of the devil, and the
covenant people on the side of the seed of the woman. This struggle
in Egypt, again, foreshadowed the still higher contest between
truth and error in the land of Canaan&mdash;a contest which endured
through so many centuries, and enlisted on both sides so many kings
and mighty men; and which, in its turn, ushered in the grand
conflict between the kingdom of Christ and that of Satan, a
conflict that began on the day of Pentecost, and is yet in
progress. This continual foreshadowing of the future by the present
is essentially of a typical nature, yet it does not constitute, in
and of itself, what we understand by a type in the ordinary usage
of the term.</p>
<p>3. <i>A type</i> is <i>a symbol appointed by God to adumbrate
something higher in the future</i>, which is called the
<i>antitype</i>. This definition includes three particulars: (1.)
The type must be a <i>true adumbration</i> of the thing typified,
though, from the very nature of the case, the adumbration must be
inadequate&mdash;a <i>shadow only</i> of the antitype, and not its
substance. Thus the paschal lamb was a type of Christ, though there
is infinitely more in the antitype than in the type. (2.) The
symbol must be <i>of divine appointment</i>, and as such, designed
by God to represent the antitype. We must carefully remember,
however, that, from the very nature of the case, the divine
intention cannot be clearly announced when the type is instituted.
The paschal lamb typified "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world;" but it was not till centuries after the
institution of the passover that God began to intimate by the
prophets the approaching sacrifice of the great Antitype (Isa.
chap. 53; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page581" id=
"page581"></a>{581}</span> Zech. 13:7), and the full import of the
type was revealed only when the sacrifice of "Christ our passover"
had been accomplished on Calvary. (3.) Since the type is "a shadow
of good things to come," it follows that the antitype must
<i>belong to the future</i>. A pure symbol may belong to the
present or the near future. It may represent something that now
exists, or is coming into existence, in respect to which
concealment is not necessary. Hence we find the sacred writers
freely explaining the meaning of the symbols which they employ
(Numb. chap. 17; Josh. 4:1-7; 1 Sam. 7:12; 10:1, and the same
symbol of anointing often elsewhere; 1 Kings 11:29-39; 22:11, where
a false prophet uses a symbol; Isa. chap. 20; Jer. 1:11-14;
13:1-11, and elsewhere; Ezek. chap. 3, and in many other passages;
Amos 7:1-9; 8:1-3; Zech. 1:8-11, and elsewhere). The true type, on
the contrary, reckoned from the time of its institution, looks
forward to the distant future. The high reality which it
foreshadows may be intimated by the prophets "as in a glass
darkly," but the appearance of the antitype can alone furnish a
full explanation of its meaning.</p>
<p>The types of the Old Testament have been variously classified.
We propose to consider them under the two divisions of
<i>historical</i> and <i>ritual</i> types.</p>
<h3>I. HISTORICAL TYPES.</h3>
<p>4. The extravagance of a class of Biblical expositors in
converting the Old Testament history into allegory typical of
persons and events under the gospel dispensation has produced a
strong reaction, leading some to deny altogether the existence of
historical types. But this is going to the other extreme of error.
No man who acknowledges the writers of the New Testament to be true
expositors of the meaning of the Old can consistently deny the
existence in the Old Testament of such types, for they interpret
portions of its history in a typical way. But it is of the highest
importance that we understand, in respect to such history, that it
has <i>a true and proper significance</i> of its own, without
respect to its typical import. It is not allegory, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page582" id="page582"></a>{582}</span> which
has, literally taken, no substance. It is not mere type, like the
rites of the Mosaic law, the meaning of which is exhausted in their
office of foreshadowing the antitype. It is veritable history,
valid for the men of its own day, fulfilling its office in the plan
of God's providence, and containing, when we look at it simply as
history, its own lessons of instruction. We call it typical history
because, following the guidance of the New Testament writers, we
are constrained to regard it as so ordered and shaped by God's
providence as to prefigure something higher in the Christian
dispensation.</p>
<p>No careful student of the New Testament can for a moment doubt
that David's kingdom typified the kingdom of Christ. There is,
indeed, a very important sense in which David's kingdom was
identical with that of Christ; for its main element was the visible
church of God, founded on the covenant made with Abraham, and
therefore in all ages one and indivisible. Rom. 11:17-24; Gal.
3:14-18; Ephes. 2:20. But we now speak of David's kingdom in its
outward form, which was temporary and typical of something higher.
In this sense it is manifest that God appointed it to foreshadow
that of the Messiah. David's headship adumbrated the higher
headship of the Redeemer; his conflicts with the enemies of God's
people and his final triumph over them, Christ's conflicts and
victories. The same thing was true of Solomon, and in a measure of
all the kings of David's line, so far as they were true to their
office as the divinely appointed leaders of the covenant people.
Unless we adopt this principle, the view which the New Testament
takes of a large number of Psalms&mdash;the so-called
<i>Messianic</i> psalms&mdash;becomes utterly visionary.</p>
<p>But neither David's kingdom nor his headship over it was mere
type. The nation over which he presided was a historic reality, a
true power among the other nations of the earth. His leadership
also, with its conflicts and triumphs, belongs to true history. It
brought to the people of his own day true deliverance from the
power of their enemies; and it contains, when we study it without
reference to its typical character, true lessons of instruction for
all ages.</p>
<p>The declarations of Scripture in respect to the typical nature
of the <i>prophetical</i> office are not so numerous and decisive
as those which relate to the kingly office. There is, however, a
remarkable passage in the book of Deuteronomy, from which we may
legitimately infer that it was truly typical of Christ. When God
had addressed the people directly from the midst of the cloud and
fire on Sinai, unable to endure this mode of communication between
God and man, they besought God that he would <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page583" id="page583"></a>{583}</span>
henceforth address them through the ministry of Moses: "Speak thou
with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we
die." Exod. 20:19. With reference to this request, God said to
Moses: "They have well spoken that which they have spoken. I will
raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,
and will put my words in his mouth: and he shall speak unto them
all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that
whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my
name, I will require it of him." Deut. 18:17-19. The essential
points of this promise are, that the promised prophet shall be like
Moses, one whose words shall be invested with supreme authority;
and, especially, that he shall be raised up from among their
brethren, and shall therefore be a man like themselves. The promise
was manifestly intended to meet the wants of the covenant people
<i>from that day and onward</i>. Yet the great Prophet in whom it
was fulfilled did not appear till after the lapse of fifteen
centuries or more. But in the mean time the promise was truly
fulfilled to God's people in a <i>typical</i> way through the
succession of prophets, who spake in God's name, and who were men
like their brethren to whom they were sent. In these two essential
particulars the prophetical office truly prefigured Christ, its
great Antitype.</p>
<p>The Old Testament contains not only typical <i>orders of
men</i>, but <i>typical transactions</i> also; that is,
transactions which, while they had their own proper significance as
a part of the history of God's church, were yet so ordered by God
as to shadow forth with remarkable clearness and force the higher
truths of Christ's kingdom. Such are the transactions between
Melchizedek and Abraham recorded in the fourteenth chapter of
Genesis. Considered simply in itself, Melchizedek's priesthood
belongs to the class of <i>ritual</i> types. But in the record of
his intercourse with Abraham there is an accumulation of historic
circumstances arranged by God's providence to shadow forth the
higher priesthood of Christ. (1.) He united in his person the
<i>kingly and priestly offices</i>, as does the Messiah. In the
hundred and tenth Psalm it is, in like manner, a king invested by
God with universal sovereignty, to whom the declaration is made:
"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
ever, after the order of Melchizedek." (2.) In <i>official
dignity</i> he was higher than Abraham, and thus higher than any of
Abraham's descendants by natural generation; for Abraham paid
tithes to him, and received from him the priestly blessing (Gen.
14:19, 20); "And without all contradiction the less is blessed of
the better." Heb. 7:7. (3.) His priesthood <i>was without
limitation</i>, and had thus the attribute of <i>universality</i>.
It was not restricted in its exercise by nationality, for Abraham
was not one of his people. (4.) He did not belong to a line of
priests, who transmitted their office from father to son. He was,
so far as we know from the record, <i>without predecessors, and had
no successor</i> in his priesthood. The author of the epistle to
the Hebrews <span class="pagenum"><a name="page584" id=
"page584"></a>{584}</span> describes him as one who is "without
father, without mother, without pedigree" (marginal rendering),
"having neither beginning of days nor end of life: but made like
unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually." Heb. 7:3. In
the interpretation of this difficult passage, we must begin with
the axiomatic principle that Melchizedek was a <i>human being</i>.
He could not have been, as some have thought, the Son of God
himself; for how could the Son of God be "made like unto the Son of
God?" Nor could he have been an angel; for angels are not partakers
of human nature, and cannot therefore typify him who came in human
nature to deliver those who are "partakers of flesh and blood."
Heb. 2:14-18; 4:15; 5:1, 2. And if he was a proper man, then he was
"without father, without mother, without pedigree," not in an
absolute sense, but with reference to his priesthood. He was a
priest whose genealogy is not mentioned, because his priesthood was
not restricted, like that of the Levitical priests, to any
particular line of descent. He held his priesthood from God,
without predecessors or successors. The words that
follow&mdash;"having neither beginning of days nor end of life: but
made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest
continually"&mdash;are more difficult. It is certain, however, that
they cannot be understood absolutely. They are commonly interpreted
upon the same principle as the preceding words; namely, that in
omitting from the inspired record every limitation of Melchizedek's
life as well as descent, it was God's purpose to shadow forth the
unlimited nature of Christ's priesthood; that, in truth, the
apostle describes Melchizedek, the type, in terms which hold good
in their full meaning only of Christ the great Antitype. They who,
admitting that Melchizedek was a human being, find the
interpretation unsatisfactory, must leave the apostle's words
shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>But whatever obscurity there is in the scriptural notices of
Melchizedek, they abundantly affirm the typical nature of his
priesthood as distinguished from that of the Levitical priests. He
was a type of Christ not simply as a priest, but also in the
peculiar character of his priesthood. He united with his priesthood
the kingly office; was superior in dignity to Abraham himself, and
thus to the Levitical priests; and his priesthood had the attribute
of universality. Here, then, we have an undoubted example of a
historic type.</p>
<p>It is not without reason that the deliverance of the covenant
people from Egypt, their journey through the wilderness of Arabia
under God's guidance, and their final settlement in the land of
promise, have been regarded as typical of the higher redemption,
guidance, and salvation received through Christ. From the earliest
ages of the Christian church this wonderful history has been an
inexhaustible storehouse of analogies for the illustration of
Christian experience. In his pilgrimage through this vale of tears,
the believer instinctively turns to it for instruction and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page585" id=
"page585"></a>{585}</span> encouragement. The mighty interposition
of God when the Israelites were "yet without strength" in their
bondage; their protection through the blood of the paschal lamb
sprinkled on the doors of their houses when the destroyer passed
through Egypt; the opening of a way through the Red sea when all
human means of escape failed them; the journey through the
wilderness; the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night to
guide, the water from the rock to refresh, the manna from heaven
morning by morning to feed them; God's faithful discipline in
contrast with human unbelief, waywardness, and folly; the final
preparation for the conquest of Canaan and its successful
accomplishment&mdash;this whole series of events is wonderfully
adapted to illustrate the course of Christian experience, and who
shall say that God did not order it with a view to this end? We do
not resolve it into mere type. We acknowledge it to be true
history, valid to the men of that age&mdash;a true earthly
deliverance, guidance, and sustenance in the wilderness, conducting
to the possession of a true earthly inheritance. But we say that it
is a history so ordered by God as to typify the higher pilgrimage
of the believer to the heavenly Canaan. It is undeniable that the
writer to the Hebrews regards the rest of the covenant people in
the land of promise as a type of the rest of heaven. Heb. 3:7-4:11.
And if that part of the history was typical, it is reasonable to
infer that the whole was typical. It belongs to the nature of a
type that it should, on the one hand, come short of the fulness of
meaning that belongs to the antitype, and, on the other, should
contain some things which find no correspondence in that which it
adumbrates. The priesthood of the sons of Aaron, as we shall see,
typified Christ's priesthood, but only inadequately, as a shadow
represents the substance; while sinfulness, which belonged to all
the priests of Aaron's line, not only did not correspond to the
character of the Antitype, but was in contradiction with it. So is
it also with the historical types that have been under
consideration. They represent the antitype inadequately, and only
in certain respects.</p>

<h3>II. RITUAL TYPES.</h3>
<p>5. The <i>sacrifices</i> were the central part of the Jewish
ritual. But sacrifices imply <i>offerers</i>, a <i>personal God</i>
to whom the offering is made, and a <i>priesthood</i> through which
it is presented. In the primitive ages of the world, men offered
sacrifices in their own behalf and that of their household in
whatever place it was their chance to sojourn. Gen. 4:4; 8:20;
12:7, 8; 31:54; 33:20; 35:1, 7; 46:1; Job 1:5; 42:8. But upon the
establishment of the Mosaic economy, the priestly office was
restricted to the family of Aaron. Thenceforward all who wished to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page586" id=
"page586"></a>{586}</span> offer sacrifices must bring them through
the mediation of the priests of Aaron's line. It belonged to the
nature of the Mosaic economy, that God should have a visible
dwelling-place among the Israelites. The directions for the
construction of the tabernacle with its furniture are introduced by
the words: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among
them." Exod. 25:8. The material sanctuary, then, was God's visible
dwelling-place, where he manifested himself to his people, and
received their worship according to the rites of his own
appointment; the whole being, as we shall see, typical of higher
realities pertaining to our redemption through Christ. And as this
earthly sanctuary was God's chosen dwelling-place, it followed, as
a necessary consequence, that after its erection all the sacrifices
must be brought to its altar, and presented there to God through
the priesthood of his appointment.</p>
<p>6. The <i>Mosaic tabernacle</i> was a movable structure very
simple in its plan. Its frame-work on three sides consisted of
upright boards, or rather timbers (for, according to the unanimous
representation of the Jewish rabbins, they were a cubit in
thickness), standing side by side, and kept in position by
transverse bars passing through golden rings. Thus was formed an
enclosure ten cubits in height, thirty cubits in length from east
to west, and ten cubits in width; the eastern end, which
constituted the front, having only a vail suspended from five
pillars of shittim-wood. Over this enclosure, and hanging down on
either side, was spread a rich covering formed by coupling together
ten curtains of "fine-twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
scarlet, with cherubim of cunning work." Over this was another
covering, formed from the union of eleven curtains of goats' hair;
and above two other coverings, the one of rams' skins dyed red, and
the other, or outermost, of badgers' skins. Surrounding the
tabernacle was a court one hundred cubits long and fifty wide,
enclosed by curtains of fine-twined linen supported on pillars five
cubits high. The tabernacle itself was divided by a vail supported
on four pillars into two parts; the <i>inner</i> sanctuary, or
"holy of holies," ten cubits <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page587" id="page587"></a>{587}</span> every way, and the
<i>outer</i>, or "holy place," twenty cubits long by ten in breadth
and height.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a wider sense the whole movable structure within the court is
called the tabernacle. But in a stricter sense the rich inner
curtain is distinguished in the Mosaic description as the
<i>tabernacle</i>, while the curtain of goats' hair is called the
<i>tent</i>. Exod. 26:1, 7; 36:8, 14, 19. The true meaning of the
word rendered in our version <i>badgers</i> is uncertain. Some
think that the seal is referred to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. We have seen that the tabernacle was God's visible
dwelling-place. But the palace of a king has its
<i>audience-rooms</i>, where he receives his subjects and attends
to their petitions. In like manner the Mosaic tabernacle, and
afterwards the temple, had its "holy of holies" and its "holy
place," the former being in a special sense the abode of Israel's
God. The tabernacle, with its furniture, priesthood, and services,
is declared in the New Testament to have been "a shadow of good
things to come." Heb. 10:1, and elsewhere. Unless we understand
this its typical character, we fail to gain any true apprehension
of its meaning.</p>
<p>8. In contemplating the truths which the Mosaic tabernacle
shadowed forth, we begin with the <i>materials</i> used in its
construction. Here we notice two things; their <i>preciousness</i>,
and the <i>gradation</i> observed in this respect.</p>
<p>(1.) Their <i>preciousness</i>. All the materials were of the
most durable and costly character&mdash;gold, silver, fine-twined
linen of blue and purple and scarlet, acacia-wood (the shittim-wood
of our version), brass being allowed only in the external
appointments. This obviously represented the glory and excellence
of God's service, and the corresponding obligation on the part of
the worshippers to give to God the best of all that they had.</p>
<p>(2.) The <i>gradation</i> in the preciousness of the materials
had reference to the inner sanctuary, where, as will presently be
shown, God dwelt between the cherubim that overshadowed the
mercy-seat. The rule of gradation was this: the nearer to God's
dwelling-place the greater the glory; and hence, as shadowing forth
this glory, the more precious the materials. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page588" id="page588"></a>{588}</span> The
mercy-seat, where God dwelt between the cherubim, was accordingly
of pure gold. All the woodwork pertaining to the tabernacle and its
furniture was overlaid with gold. The inner or proper covering of
the tabernacle, as also the vail that hung before the ark,
separating the holy from the most holy place, was of "fine-twined
linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim of cunning
work." The outer vail, at the entrance of the outer sanctuary, was
of the same materials, but without the cherubim; while the curtains
of the court were made simply of fine-twined linen, suspended from
pillars of shittim-wood not overlaid with gold. The sockets, again,
that supported the timbers of the tabernacle and the inner row of
pillars before the ark were of silver; but those beneath the outer
pillars of the sanctuary, and all the pillars of the court, were of
brass.</p>
<p>9. Passing to the <i>appointments</i> of the tabernacle, we
naturally begin with the <i>inner</i> sanctuary. Here between the
wings of the cherubim that overshadowed the mercy-seat, or lid of
the ark, was the <i>Shekinah</i>, or visible dwelling-place of
Jehovah. In the ark beneath the mercy-seat were placed, by God's
direction, the two tables of the law. Exod. 25:16 compared with 1
Kings 8:9. This was their appropriate place. It shadowed forth the
great truth that God is the fountain of law, and that they who
approach him must come in the spirit of true obedience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That God's dwelling-place was between the cherubim we learn from
the original direction for the construction of the ark: "And thou
shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou
shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. And there will I
meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the
mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of
the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment
unto the children of Israel." Exod. 25:21, 22. In accordance with
these words God repeatedly promised that he would meet with Moses
at the mercy-seat (Exod. 30:36; Lev. 16:2; Numb. 17:4); and after
the dedication of the tabernacle and its altar, it is recorded that
"when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to
speak with Him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page589" id=
"page589"></a>{589}</span> him from off the mercy-seat that was
upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim." Numb.
7:89. Hence Jehovah is described in the Old Testament as he that
dwells between the cherubim. 1 Sam. 4:4; 2 Sam. 6:2; 2 Kings 19:15;
Psa. 80:1; 99:1; Isa. 37:16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>10. In the <i>outer</i> sanctuary, before the vail that
separated it from the holy of holies, stood, on the south side, the
<i>golden candlestick</i>, with its seven lamps burning always
before the Lord (Exod. 27:20; 40:24, 25; Lev. 24:25), and on the
north side the <i>table of show-bread</i>, with its twelve loaves
renewed every week (Exod. 25:30; 40:22, 23; Lev. 24:5-9). These
typified the light and the life that come from God's presence
through the ordinances of his appointment; and since the end of
these ordinances is Jesus Christ, they shadowed him forth as the
light of the world and the bread of life. John 8:12; 12:46;
6:35-58; and especially John 1:4. Between the golden candlestick
and the table of show-bread, consequently directly in front of the
ark, and separated from it by the inner vail, was the <i>golden
altar of incense</i>, on which the priests burned sweet incense
every morning and evening before the Lord (Exod. 30:6-8; 40:26,
27), whereby was shadowed forth Christ's intercession, through
which the prayers of saints are made acceptable to God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the book of Revelation an angel is represented as offering
upon this golden altar much incense with the prayers of all saints.
"And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand." Rev. 8:3,
4. This passage seems to warrant the interpretation above given to
this symbol; not that the ancient covenant people understood fully
its meaning, or that of the other symbolic rites, but that such was
the mind of the Spirit, to be made manifest in due time.</p>
<p>There is a view of the Mosaic ceremonial, which makes it simply
a <i>scenic representation</i> of a king's court; in which the
tabernacle represents the royal palace, the incense the homage
rendered to the monarch (compare Dan. 2:46), the sacrifices,
show-bread, and other unbloody offerings the provision made for his
table, the priests his ministering servants, etc.; by which the
whole is reduced to the idea of service rendered to Jehovah as the
national monarch, and all typical representation of the provision
made by God for man's spiritual wants is excluded. This
interpretation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page590" id=
"page590"></a>{590}</span> of the Mosaic ritual is as superficial
as it is false. In this ritual, service is indeed rendered to God;
but it is a service which typically shadows forth the provision
which God makes for man's wants as a fallen being&mdash;light for
his darkened understanding, life for his spiritual nature dead in
trespasses and sins, and reconciliation to God through the blood of
Christ. This is the constant interpretation given in the New
Testament of the "carnal ordinances" of the Old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>11. In the court before the tabernacle stood the <i>brazen
altar</i> with its <i>laver</i>. Here the blood of the sacrifices
flowed from age to age&mdash;a lamb every morning and evening, and
on the Sabbath day two lambs morning and evening, besides all the
public sacrifices connected with the national festivals, and the
private sacrifices of individuals. The New Testament teaches us
that the <i>Levitical priests</i> who ministered at the Jewish
altar <i>typified Christ</i>, our great High Priest. In the one
hundred and tenth psalm, which the Saviour himself quotes as
written by David "in spirit," and as referring to himself (Matt.
22:41-45; Mark 12:35-37) the Messiah is represented as uniting in
himself the kingly and the priestly office. There is a remarkable
symbolical transaction in Zechariah (chap. 6:9-14) which contains
the same representation. The prophet is directed, in the presence
of competent witnesses, to "take silver and gold, and make crowns,
and set them upon the head of Joshua [the Hebrew word answering to
the Greek <i>Jesus</i>, which stands in the Septuagint rendering of
this passage] the son of Josedech, the high priest." In his office
as high priest Joshua typifies Christ our great High Priest. By the
symbolical act of crowning Joshua is typified <i>the kingly office
of Christ as united with the priestly</i>. Hence the prophet is
directed by God to add: "Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying,
Behold the man whose name is the BRANCH" (compare chap. 3:8, and
Isa. 11:1; Jer. 23:4-6; 33:15, 16); "and he shall grow up out of
his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord: even he shall
build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and
shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon
his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both."
In accordance with these representations a large <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page591" id="page591"></a>{591}</span> part of
the epistle to the Hebrews is occupied with a discussion of our
Lord's priestly office, in which, beyond contradiction, he is
exhibited as the great antitype of both Melchizedec and the
Levitical priests.</p>
<p>12. If the Levitical priests typified Christ, it follows that
the <i>sacrifices</i> which they offered <i>were also typical of
Christ's sacrifice</i> for the sins of the world. So the epistle to
the Hebrews argues: "Every high priest is ordained to offer gifts
and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have
somewhat also to offer." Chap. 8:3. The Levitical priests stood
"daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,
which can never take away sins." Chap. 10:11. Their offerings were
only <i>typical of expiation</i>, and needed therefore to be
continually repeated till the Antitype itself should appear. But
Christ offered his own blood on Calvary, by which he obtained
eternal redemption for us, so that his sacrifice needs no
repetition. He was "once offered to bear the sins of many;" and by
this "one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified." Chaps. 9:11-14, 25, 26; 10:10-14.</p>
<p>But this doctrine respecting the typical character of the
Levitical sacrifices is not restricted to the epistle to the
Hebrews. The New Testament is full of it. John the Baptist, the
Saviour's forerunner, announced him as "the Lamb of God which
taketh away the sin of the world." John 1:29. Whether we render, as
in the margin of our version, "which <i>beareth</i> the sin of the
world," or, as in the text, "which <i>taketh away</i> the sin of
the world," the words contain the idea of a <i>propitiatory</i>
sacrifice, or, which amounts to the same thing, an <i>expiatory</i>
sacrifice; since it is by expiating our sin that Christ propitiates
the Father. By bearing the sin of the world Christ expiates it, and
thus takes it away. Thus he is "the propitiation for our sins, and
not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." 1
John 2:2.</p>
<p>The Saviour himself announced his purpose to die for his people:
"I lay down my life for the sheep." "Therefore doth my Father love
me because I lay down my life, that I might <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page592" id="page592"></a>{592}</span> take it
again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I
have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This
commandment have I received of my Father." John 10:15, 17, 18. And
lest any should think that he died simply in the character of a
martyr, he elsewhere explains that "the Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
many"&mdash;more literally, "a ransom instead of many" (Matt.
20:28; Mark 10:45), where the sacrificial and vicarious nature of
our Lord's death is explicitly affirmed.</p>
<p>But it was after our Lord's resurrection that the sacrificial
and propitiatory character of his death was most fully revealed. We
have seen the view taken of it in the epistle to the Hebrews. With
this the other writers of the New Testament are in harmony. Jesus
Christ is the great sufferer foretold in the fifty-third chapter of
Isaiah, who "was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our
iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with
his stripes we are healed;" upon whom the Lord "laid the iniquity
of us all;" who was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth;
whose soul God made "an offering for sin;" who "was numbered with
the transgressors," and "bare the sins of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors." 1 Pet. 2:24, 25; Acts 8:32-35;
Mark 15:28; Luke 22:37. He "hath once suffered for sins, the just
for the unjust, that he might bring us to God" (1 Pet. 3:18); He
has redeemed us to God by his blood (Rev. 5:9); has "loved us and
washed us from our sins in his own blood" (Rev. 1:5); and his
redeemed "have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb" (Rev. 7:14).</p>
<p>To recite all the declarations of the apostle Paul on this great
theme would be a superfluous work. It is not through Christ's
example or teachings, but <i>through his blood</i> that we have
"redemption, the forgiveness of sins." Ephes. 1:7. "Christ hath
redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us"
(Gal. 3:13), words which teach as explicitly as <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page593" id="page593"></a>{593}</span> human
language can, that Christ has delivered us from the penalty of the
divine law, which is its curse, by bearing the curse in our behalf.
This he did when he was hanged on the tree. His death on the cross
was, then, <i>vicarious</i>, a death in our stead; and
<i>propitiatory</i>, for in view of it God releases us from the
curse of the law. This is what is meant by a <i>propitiatory</i>
sacrifice. Finally, as if to cut off all ground for the assertion
that the efficacy of Christ's death lies wholly in its moral
influence upon the human heart&mdash;its humbling, softening, and
winning power&mdash;the apostle teaches that God has set forth
Christ Jesus as a propitiation through faith in his blood for a
manifestation of his righteousness, "<i>that he might be just, and
the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus</i>." Rom. 3:25,
26.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every word of this weighty passage deserves serious
consideration. We give by the side of the English version another
translation, intended to be somewhat more literal:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="15" summary="Comparison">

faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the passing

righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifier of him

</table>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From these words we learn: (1.) That God has publicly set forth
Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice. The following paraphrase gives
the probable connection of the words of the first clause: Whom God,
by means of his blood, hath set forth as a propitiation through
faith. But if we take the connection as given in our version, the
propitiation is still through Christ's blood, and is thus a
propitiatory or expiatory sacrifice. (2.) That the appropriation to
individual sinners of this propitiation is conditioned on personal
faith. Christ's propitiatory sacrifice does not, in and of itself,
justify any man; but it provides a <i>ground</i> whereby all may be
justified, if they will believe in Jesus. (3.) That through
Christ's propitiatory sacrifice God makes a public manifestation of
his righteousness in showing mercy to sinners. The phrase, "the
righteousness of God," may mean, in the usage of Paul, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page594" id="page594"></a>{594}</span> the
righteousness&mdash;justification&mdash;which <i>he gives</i>
through faith. But in connection with the words that follow, "that
he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in
Jesus," it can only mean righteousness as an attribute of God, his
public justice, namely, as the lawgiver and governor of the world.
(4.) That Christ's propitiatory sacrifice was necessary in order
that God might show mercy to sinners consistently with the demands
of his justice. For when the apostle says "that God might be just,
and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus," the words
necessarily imply that, without this sacrifice, he could not have
been just in justifying sinners. Christ's propitiation was not
needed to make God more merciful <i>in his nature</i>; for in this
respect he is unchangeably "the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever." But it <i>opens a way</i> by which he may show mercy
consistently with his justice and the sanctity of his law. When we
raise inquiries concerning the interior nature of the atonement, we
meet with deep mysteries, some of which are, perhaps, above the
comprehension of finite human understanding. But we can comprehend,
and believe upon God's testimony, the great central fact of the
gospel, that Christ offered himself to the Father to bear in human
nature the curse of the divine law in behalf of sinners; and that
God accepted this propitiatory offering as a satisfaction to his
justice in such a sense that he can pardon all who believe in
Christ without dishonor to himself or injury to his moral

<p>13. We have considered Christ as the great Antitype of the
Levitical priests and sacrifices. Let us now go back and consider
the <i>characteristics belonging to the types themselves</i>,
beginning with the priesthood.</p>
<p>(1.) The first point in which the Levitical priests typified
Christ was in their possession of <i>the same common human
nature</i> as those in whose behalf they acted. "For both he that
sanctifieth [Christ] and they who are sanctified [believers] are
all of one [one Father, having a common sonship as members of the
same family of Adam]: for which cause he is not ashamed to call
them brethren" (Heb. 2:11); and again: "Forasmuch then as the
children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
took part of the same" (ver. 14); and still further: "Wherefore in
all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren; that
he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things
pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people. For in that he himself hath <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page595" id="page595"></a>{595}</span> suffered, being tempted, he
is able to succor them that are tempted" (ver. 17, 18; and compare
4:15). Accordingly the priests who typified Christ were taken from
among men, not angels; and "able to have compassion on the
ignorant, and on them that are out of the way," being themselves
"compassed with infirmity." Heb. 5:1, 2.</p>
<p>(2.) The Levitical priests, again, were <i>appointed to their
office by God</i>: "And no man taketh this honor upon himself, but
he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So also Christ glorified
not himself to be made a high priest; but he that said unto him,
Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in
another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedec." Heb. 5:4-6.</p>
<p>(3.) The Levitical priests, once more, were <i>mediators between
God and the people</i>. After the establishment of their
priesthood, no Israelite or sojourner in the land could approach
God with sacrifices and oblations in his own right, and be his own
priest. He must come to God through the priesthood of his
appointment&mdash;an expressive type of the great truth announced
by Christ; "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father but by me." John 14:6.</p>
<p>(4.) Finally, the Levitical priests were not only mediators
between God and men, but <i>mediators through propitiatory
sacrifices</i>. They were ordained to "offer both gifts and
sacrifices for sins." Heb. 5:1; 8:3. "Wherefore," adds the writer,
"it is of necessity that this man [Christ] have somewhat also to
offer." Heb. 8:3. They offered the blood of bulls and goats, which
made expiation only in a typical way; he offered to God his own
blood as a real propitiation for sin. Heb. 7:27; 9:12-28;
10:10-14.</p>
<p>The points of <i>dissimilarity</i> between the Levitical priests
and Christ, as stated in the epistle to the Hebrews, all serve to
illustrate the superior dignity and efficacy of his priesthood.
They were sinful men, and as such needing to offer sacrifice first
for their own sins (chap. 5:3); but he is "holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page596" id=
"page596"></a>{596}</span> (chap. 7:26). They were many, "because
they were not suffered to continue, by reason of death:" but he,
"because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."
Chap. 7:23, 24. Their offerings could not take away sin. They were
only typical of expiation, and therefore needed to be continually
repeated. But Christ has by his one offering "perfected for ever
them that are sanctified"&mdash;perfected them in respect to the
expiation of sin, which is the foundation on which the work of
personal sanctification rests. Heb. 10:11, 12.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mediatorship between God and man through propitiatory sacrifice
constitutes the central idea of priesthood. The Levitical priests
did indeed make intercession for the people in the burning of sweet
incense (see above, No. 8), and in presenting to God their unbloody
offerings, but all this was done <i>through the blood of
atonement</i>. We see, then, how false and mischievous is the idea
that there can be true mediating priests under the New Testament
dispensation. Christ appeared once for all "to put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself" (Heb. 9:25-28; 10:10-12), since which no
further sacrifice is needed, or can be lawfully offered. Christ
also opened to all believers through his blood a new and living way
of access to God, through which they can come boldly to the throne
of grace, having no need of human mediators. Heb. 10:18-22.
Believers as a body are "a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." 1 Pet. 2:5. They
present themselves to God "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to
God." Rom. 12:1. They "offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of their lips, giving thanks to his
name." Heb. 13:15. These spiritual sacrifices offered by the body
of believers through Christ, their glorified High Priest, are the
only sacrifices known to the New Testament church.</p>
<p>Of the high priest's garments, made by divine direction "for
glory and for beauty," we cannot here speak in detail. Suffice it
to say that they represented in general the dignity and excellence
of his office, as the divinely appointed mediator between God and
the covenant people. The golden plate with the inscription HOLINESS
TO THE LORD is its own interpreter. The twelve names of the tribes
of Israel, graven on two precious stones, and borne on the
shoulders of the high priest, six on each shoulder, and then the
same twelve graven on twelve gems, and borne on his breast as he
ministered before the Lord, beautifully typify Christ our great
High Priest, who bears his people on his shoulders by his almighty
power and efficacious atonement, and on his heart by his
everlasting love.</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page597" id=
"page597"></a>{597}</span>
<p>14. From the typical priests we naturally pass to the
consideration of the <i>typical sacrifices</i> offered by them.
Upon Noah's leaving the ark, God prohibited the eating of blood on
the ground that it is the <i>life</i> of the animal. Gen. 9:4. The
reason of this prohibition is unfolded in a passage of the Mosaic
law, which clearly sets forth the nature and design of bloody
offerings: "And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or
of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
blood, I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood,
and will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the
flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to
make an atonement for your souls: <span class="smcap">for it is the
blood that maketh an atonement for the soul</span>." Lev. 17:10,
11. Hence the sprinkling of the sacrificial blood by the priest as
a sign of expiation, a rite that will be more particularly
considered hereafter (No. 15). The reason that the <i>blood</i>
makes the atonement is that "the <i>life</i> of the flesh is in the
blood." The scriptural idea, then, of a sacrifice is the offering
to God of one life in behalf of another that has been forfeited by
sin&mdash;the life of the innocent beast instead of the life of the
guilty offerer. This general idea of the vicarious and propitiatory
nature of sacrifices comes out with beautiful simplicity and
clearness in the book of Job: "And it was so when the days of their
feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and
rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according
to the number of them all: for Job said, <i>It may be that my sons
have sinned</i>, and cursed God in their hearts." Chap. 1:5. And
again: "My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two
friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as
my servant Job hath. Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and
seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a
burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly." Chap. 42:7, 8.
The sacrifices of the Mosaic law were of various kinds, implying
various accessory ideas. But underlying them all was the
fundamental idea of <i>propitiation through blood</i>. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page598" id="page598"></a>{598}</span> Hence the
writer to the Hebrews, when commenting on the transaction recorded
in Exodus, chap. 24:4-8, says: "And almost all things are by the
law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no
remission." Heb. 9:22. The only exception was in the case of the
poor man who was "not able to bring two turtle doves or two young
pigeons." He was allowed to "bring for his offering the tenth part
of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering" (Lev. 5:11), upon the
principle that God "will have mercy and not sacrifice."</p>
<p>No orderly classification of sacrifices is to be sought without
the pale of the Jewish ceremonial. The burnt-offerings, for
example, mentioned in the book of Job, had the force of proper
sin-offerings. Chaps. 1:5; 42:8. The classification in the book of
Leviticus is into burnt-offerings, sin-offerings,
trespass-offerings, and peace-offerings. But they may be most
conveniently considered in the order of their presentation, when
two or more of them were offered on the same occasion, as when
Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priesthood, and the
people sanctified in connection with this transaction (Lev. chaps
8, 9), and in the offerings of the great day of atonement (Lev.
chap. 16).</p>
<p>Here the <i>sin-offering</i> naturally held the first place; for
this, as its name indicates, was wholly expiatory and propitiatory,
bringing the offerer into a state of forgiveness and divine favor.
The sin-offerings had reference (1) to sin generally, as when Aaron
and his sons were consecrated and the people sanctified, and when,
on the annual day of atonement, expiation was made for the sins of
the past year; (2) to specific offences (Lev. chaps. 4, 5), The
exact distinction between the sin-offering and the
<i>trespass-offering</i> is of difficult determination. Both were
alike expiatory, were in fact subdivisions of the same class of
offerings. A comparison of the passages in which trespass-offerings
are prescribed (Lev. 5:1; 6:1-7; Numb. 5:6-8) seems to indicate
that they belonged especially to trespasses for which restitution
could be made.</p>
<p>Next in the order of sacrifices, though first in dignity, came
the <i>burnt-offering</i>, also called <i>holocaust</i> (Heb.
<i>kalil</i>) that is, <i>whole burnt-offering</i>, the
characteristic mark of which was the consuming of the whole by fire
(Lev. chap. 1). It is conceded by all that this was a <i>symbol of
completeness</i>; but in what respect is a question that has been
answered in different ways. Some refer the completeness to the
offering itself, as that form of sacrifice which embraces in itself
all others (Rosenm&uuml;ller on Deut. 33:10); or, as the most
perfect offering, inasmuch as it exhibits the idea of offering in
its <span class="pagenum"><a name="page599" id=
"page599"></a>{599}</span> completeness and generality, and so
concentrates in itself all worship. B&auml;hr, Symbolik, vol. 2, p.
362. But we cannot separate, in the intention of God, the
completeness of the form from the state of the offerer's mind. The
burnt-offering was indeed, in its outward form, the most perfect of
all sacrifices, for which reason it excluded female victims, as
relatively inferior to the male sex. But because of this its
completeness and generality it signified the <i>entire
self-consecration of the offerer to God</i>. Winer and others after
Philo. But this, let it be carefully remembered, was a
self-consecration that could be made only <i>through the blood of
expiation</i>, to indicate which, the blood of the burnt-offering
was sprinkled by the priest "round about upon the altar;" or, in
the case of a bird, where the quantity was too small to be thus
sprinkled, was "wrung out at the side of the altar."</p>
<p>The <i>peace-offering</i> (more literally, <i>offering of
renditions</i>; that is, offering in which the offerer rendered to
God the tribute of praise and thanksgiving which was his due) was
in all its different subdivisions&mdash;thank-offering, votive
offering, free-will offering (Lev. 7:11-16)&mdash;a
<i>eucharistic</i> offering. Hence its <i>social</i> character.
After the sprinkling of the blood, the burning of the prescribed
parts on the altar, and the assignment to the priest of his
portion, the offerer and his friends feasted joyfully before the
Lord on the remainder. Lev. chap. 3 compared with chap. 7:11-18. In
the case of monarchs, like David and Solomon, the whole nation was
feasted. 2 Sam. 6:17-19; 1 Kings 8:62-66. Hence the Messiah, as the
great King of all nations, is beautifully represented as paying his
peace-offerings to God for the deliverance granted him from his
foes, and as summoning all nations to the sacrificial feast: "My
praise shall be of thee in the great congregation; I will pay my
vows [vows in the form of peace-offerings] before them that fear
him. The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
Lord that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. All the ends of
the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord," etc. Psa.
22:25-31. The peace-offering naturally followed the burnt-offering,
as that did the sin-offering in the sanctification of the
Israelitish congregation. Lev. 9:15-18. It signified joyful
communion with God in thanksgiving and praise; but this, too, only
<i>through the blood of the victim</i> sprinkled upon the altar as
a sign of expiation. Lev. chap. 3. In these three classes of
offerings, then, we have typically set forth, first,
<i>expiation</i> restoring man to God's favor, then
<i>self-consecration</i>, then holy <i>communion</i> in
thanksgiving and praise&mdash;<span class="smcap">all three only
through the sprinkling of the blood of christ</span>, the great
Antitype of the Levitical priests and sacrifices.</p>
<p>The sacrificial nature of the <i>passover</i> appears in the
direction given at its institution that the blood of the paschal
lamb should be sprinkled on the lintel and two side-posts of the
house where it was eaten as a protection against the destroyer of
the first-born (Exod. 12:22, 23); and in the ordinance afterwards
established, requiring that it should be slain at the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page600" id="page600"></a>{600}</span> sanctuary
(Deut. 16:1-8), and its blood sprinkled upon the altar. 2 Chron.
30:16; 35:11. Its character approached very near to that of the
peace-offerings. It was a joyous festival, commemorative of the
deliverance of Israel from Egyptian bondage; and thus typically
shadowing forth the higher redemption of God's people from the
bondage of sin. As the blood of the paschal lamb sprinkled on the
doors of the houses protected the inmates from the destroyer of the
first-born, so does the blood of Christ protect all who through
faith receive its expiatory power from the wrath to come. As the
Israelites feasted joyfully on the flesh of the paschal lamb, so
does the church feed by faith on the great antitypal Lamb of God,
who is the true Passover sacrificed for us. 1 Cor. 5:7.</p>
<p>There were some other sacrifices of a special character, such as
those by which the covenant between God and the people was ratified
(Exod. 24:3-8); the ram of consecration, when Aaron and his sons
were inducted into the priesthood (Lev. 8:22-30); the sacrifice and
other rites connected with the cleansing of the leper (Lev.
14:1-32); the sacrifice of the red heifer from which were prepared
the ashes of purification (Numb. chap. 19); the sacrifice of the
heifer in the case of an uncertain murder (Deut. 21:1-9).
Respecting these, it is only necessary to remark generally that,
whatever other ideas were typified by them, that of expiation
through blood was not wanting.</p>
<p>It was required by the law that all the sacrificial victims
should be without blemish, not only because the offering to God of
an imperfect victim would have been an affront to his majesty (Mal.
1:8, 13, 14), but especially because a perfect victim could alone
typify the Lamb of God, "without blemish and without spot," who was
offered on Calvary as the propitiation for the sins of the whole
world. 1 Pet. 1:19, 20.</p>
<p>Of the <i>unbloody offerings</i> [<i>oblations</i>, called in
our version <i>meat-offerings</i>], some were supplementary to the
sacrifices, being necessary to their completeness. Such was the
salt which, as a symbol of purity and friendship, was prescribed
for all meat offerings (Lev. 2:13), and seems to have been used
with all sacrifices also. Ezek. 43:24 compared with Mark 9:49.
Such, also were the flour, wine, and oil offered with the daily
sacrifice (Exod. 29:40), and in certain other cases. Lev. 8:26;
9:17; 14:10, etc. Other oblations, like those prescribed in the
second chapter of Leviticus, were presented by themselves, as
expressions of love, gratitude, and devotion to God on the part of
the offerers. After a portion of them, including all the
frankincense, had been burned on the altar, the rest went to Aaron
and his sons as their portion.</p>
<p>The priests also received specified portions from the
peace-offerings of the people, the trespass-offerings, and the
sin-offerings the blood of which was not carried into the
sanctuary. See Lev. chap. 6:24-7:34.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page601" id=
"page601"></a>{601}</span>
<p>15. Of the <i>typical transactions</i> connected with the
offering of sacrifices and oblations we notice the following:</p>
<p>(1.) In all cases the offerer <i>laid his hands upon the head of
the victim</i>. The meaning of this act may be inferred from the
first mention of it in the Levitical ceremonial: "And he shall put
his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be
accepted for him to make atonement for him." Lev. 1:4. The act in
question was, then, the solemn dedication to Jehovah of the victim
for the end proposed. By the laying on of his hands, he presented
it to God as his offering to make atonement for his soul, and God
accepted it as such. From the very nature of the offering, this act
of presentation contained an acknowledgment of guilt that needed
expiation, but there was no formal transfer of his sins to the
victim, as in the case of the scape-goat. See below, No. 16.</p>
<p>(2.) The <i>waving</i> and <i>heaving</i> of offerings belonged
to the priests alone. Both were manifestly acts of presentation and
dedication to God. For example, the loaf of bread, cake of oiled
bread, and wafer of unleavened bread employed upon the occasion of
Aaron's consecration were first placed in his hands to be waved
before the Lord, and then burned by Moses on the altar of
burnt-offering. Exod. 29:23-25. So also the breast of the ram of
consecration was waved, and the right shoulder heaved, before they
were eaten by Aaron and his sons (Exod. 29:26-28); the lamb of the
leper who had been healed, with the accompanying oblation, was
waved by the priest before the Lord before slaying it. Lev. 14:12,
seq.</p>
<p>According to the rabbins, the waving consisted of a movement
forwards and backwards. Some think that there was also a lateral
motion from right to left and the reverse. The heaving was a
movement upwards and downwards. The ground of the distinction
between these two forms of presentation to Jehovah is uncertain. We
only know that the ceremony of heaving was restricted to certain
cases. Thus the breast of the peace-offerings was always waved, and
the right shoulder heaved, before they were given to the priests as
their portion. Lev. 7:28-34.</p>
<p>(3.) The <i>sprinkling of the victim's blood</i> was a most
weighty part of the ceremonial, for by this expiation was
symbolized. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page602" id=
"page602"></a>{602}</span> It was accordingly restricted to the
priest, who was the appointed mediator between God and the people.
The sevenfold sprinkling of the blood that was carried into the
sanctuary (Lev. 4:6, 17; 16:14, 19), and in certain other cases
(Lev. 8:11; 14:7, 51) denoted the <i>completeness</i> of the
expiation, seven being the well-known symbol of perfection. Hence
the New Testament beautifully represents believers as purified from
sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, the great Antitype of
the Mosaic sacrifices. Heb. 9:13, 14; 10:22; 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:2.</p>
<p>Kindred to the rite of sprinkling was the application of the
victim's blood to the horns of the altar and to the person of the
offerer. Exod. 29:12, 20; Lev. 4:7, 18, 25, 30; 8:15, 24; 14:14,
etc.</p>
<p>(4.) The <i>burning</i> of the offering, or of certain specified
parts of it, upon the altar, whereby its odor ascended up to
heaven, was a natural expression of dedication to God. Compare Gen.
8:21, Lev. 1:9, etc.</p>
<p>16. We have seen the typical import of the furniture of the
tabernacle (Nos. 8 and 9 above). That the <i>tabernacle itself</i>,
considered generally, had also a typical meaning, is admitted by
all who believe in revelation. But when we come to the
consideration of details, we encounter diversities of
interpretation which cannot be here considered. We notice only the
following points:</p>
<p>(1.) The Mosaic tabernacle was, as we have seen, God's visible
earthly dwelling-place. As such, it shadowed forth his real
presence and glory, first, in the church of the redeemed on earth
through Jesus Christ; secondly, in the glorified church in heaven.
Some think that the outer sanctuary, with its altar of incense, its
golden candlestick, and its table of show-bread, typified God's
presence with the church militant, through her divinely-appointed
ordinances; and the inner sanctuary, his presence with the church
triumphant in heaven.</p>
<p>(2.) Under the Mosaic economy, the people were not admitted to
either sanctuary. They could approach God only through the
mediation of the priests. The priests themselves <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page603" id="page603"></a>{603}</span> entered
the outer sanctuary daily to burn incense and perform the other
prescribed services; but the high priest alone was permitted to
enter the most holy place once every year with the blood of the
sin-offering. This represented that, under the old dispensation,
the way of access to God on the part of sinners was not yet made
manifest. In respect to the holy of holies, we have the express
statement of inspiration: "But into the second went the high priest
alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for
himself, and for the errors of the people: the Holy Ghost this
signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made
manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing." Heb.
9:7, 8. By parity of reason, the principle holds good in respect to
the exclusion of the people from the outer sanctuary. We are
informed, accordingly, that when Christ cried upon the cross with a
loud voice, "It is finished," and gave up the ghost, "the vail of
the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom." Matt.
27:50, 51; Mark 15:37, 38; Luke 23:45, 46. By this was signified
that now the way of access to God was opened through Christ's blood
to all believers; so that they constitute a spiritual priesthood,
having access to God within the vail without the help of any
earthly mediation, that they may there "offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." Heb. 7:25; 10:19,
20; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6.</p>
<p>(3.) The typical character of the tabernacle appears very
strikingly in the ceremonies of the great day of atonement. Lev.
chap. 16. After the high-priest had first offered a sin-offering
for himself, and sprinkled its blood in the inner sanctuary upon
and before the mercy-seat seven times, he brought the two goats
that had been appointed for the expiation of the people, one for a
sin-offering, the other for a scape-goat, the office of each being
determined by lot. When he had slain the goat of the sin-offering,
he carried its blood into the most holy place, and sprinkled it
also seven times upon and before the mercy-seat, to "make an
atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the
children of Israel, and because <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page604" id="page604"></a>{604}</span> of their transgressions in
all their sins (ver. 16)." Then it was directed that the live goat
should be brought: "And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the
head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of
the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their
sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the goat
shall bear upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited;
and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness." Ver. 21, 22. By
this double ceremonial was signified, first, that Christ should
<i>expiate</i> our sins by his own blood; secondly, that through
this expiation he should <i>bear</i> them in his own person, and
thus <i>remove</i> them far away from us. The Jewish high priest
entered year by year through the earthly tabernacle into God's
presence with the blood of the sin-offering, that he might sprinkle
it before the mercy-seat. But Christ, our great High Priest, has
entered "by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with
hands" into heaven itself, to present his own blood before the
throne of God as a perfect propitiation for our sins. Heb 9:11, 12,
24.</p>
<p>The striking ceremonial connected with the scape-goat on the
great day of atonement (Lev. chap. 16) is never to be interpreted
separately, but always in connection with the other goat, which was
slain as a sin-offering, and its blood carried within the vail into
the most holy place. The inadequacy of the type made it necessary
that <i>two</i> goats should be used in this <i>one</i> service,
one to represent the expiation of the people's sin through the
sprinkling of its blood; the other, the vicarious bearing and
taking away of their sin. Whatever difficulties are connected with
the interpretation of the Hebrew word rendered in our version "for
a scape-goat" (Hebrew, <i>la-azazel</i>), the typical meaning of
the transaction is clear, and it has its fulfilment only in Christ,
who has <i>expiated</i>, and so <i>taken away</i>, the sin of the
world.</p>
<p>(4.) In the case of the more solemn sacrifices&mdash;the
sin-offerings for the high-priest and for the congregation (Lev.
4:1-21; chap. 16)&mdash;the expiatory blood was carried into the
sanctuary to be presented before God. But the victim was in all
cases slain without the sanctuary; and when its blood was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page605" id=
"page605"></a>{605}</span> carried into the sanctuary, its body
typically bearing the curse of the violated law, was burned without
the camp. In correspondence with this, the writer to the Hebrews
reminds us that "Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
his own blood, suffered without the gate." Heb. 13:11, 12. He
suffered "without the gate" in a two-fold sense. As a condemned
malefactor, he was thrust out of the holy city, which answered to
the ancient Israelitish camp, and there he expiated on the cross
the sin of the world. He also suffered "without the gate" of the
true holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, which he left that he might
tabernacle among men and die for their redemption; and having
accomplished this work, he went "by his own blood" into the
heavenly holy of holies, there to make intercession for us.</p>
<p>The dignity and sacredness of these solemn sin-offerings made it
necessary that a clean place should be selected for the burning of
the flesh; but inasmuch as they were typically laden with the curse
of sin, they were carried without the precincts of the camp where
God dwelt, and there consumed, where the ashes of all the bloody
offerings were poured out. Lev. 4:11, 12, 21; 16:27. The man,
moreover, who performed the service of burning the sin-offering on
the day of atonement, having been typically defiled by contact with
it, was required to wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water
before coming into the camp. Lev. 16:28. In the case of the
scape-goat, "the wilderness," the "land not inhabited," answered to
the place without the camp where the sin-offering was burned; and
the man that led him away was, in like manner, required to wash his
clothes and bathe his flesh in water before reentering the camp.
Lev. 16:26.</p>
<p>17. The <i>distinctions between clean and unclean</i> in respect
to articles of food and various other particulars, had also a
typical meaning. That the regulations in regard to these matters
were promotive of physical purity and health is undoubtedly true;
yet we are not to consider them as simply a sanitary code. They
reached to the inner man. Through these physical distinctions of
clean and unclean God educated the people to an apprehension of the
difference between moral purity and impurity.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page606" id=
"page606"></a>{606}</span>
<p>The Levitical view of sickness and every bodily infirmity is
deep and fundamental. All is referred to sin as the primal cause.
The sufferer from leprosy and various other infirmities (Lev.
chaps. 12-15) is regarded not as a sinner above other men (Luke
13:1-5), but yet as suffering in the character of a sinner. Hence
the ceremonial uncleanness of such persons, and the expiatory
offerings required in the case of those who have been healed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<h3>INTERPRETATION OF PROPHECY.</h3>
<p>1. The scriptural idea of prophecy is widely removed from that
of human foresight and presentiment. It is that of <i>a revelation
made by the Holy Spirit respecting the future</i>, always in the
interest of God's kingdom. It is no part of the plan of prophecy to
gratify vain curiosity respecting "the times or the seasons which
the Father hath put in his own power." Acts 1:7. "Comfort ye,
comfort ye my people, saith your God"&mdash;this is its key-note.
In its form it is carefully adapted to this great end. Its notices
of the future are interwoven with exhortations and admonitions,
encouragements and warnings, promises and threatenings. These
constitute, indeed, the great bulk of the prophetical writings that
have come down to us. The subject of the interpretation of prophecy
may be conveniently considered under the following heads:
prophecies relating to the near future; prophecies relating to the
last days; the question of double sense; the question of literal
and figurative meaning.</p>
<h3>I. PROPHECIES RELATING TO THE NEAR FUTURE.</h3>
<p>2. The Bible contains many prophecies relating to the
comparatively near future. These are all <i>specific</i> in their
character, and have a <i>single</i> exhaustive fulfilment. Examples
are: the prediction to Noah of the approaching deluge, and to
Abraham of the bondage of his posterity in a strange land; the
disclosure through Pharaoh's dreams of the coming famine in Egypt;
Joseph's announcement of the future deliverance of Israel from
Egypt; the token given to Moses that God had sent him: "When thou
hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
this mountain" (Exod. 3:12); God's threatened judgments upon the
house of Eli with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page608" id=
"page608"></a>{608}</span> accompanying sign (1 Sam. 2:34); the
warning that David received by Urim and Thummim of Saul's approach
to destroy him (1 Sam. 23:9-12); the prediction that Josiah should
defile Jeroboam's altar at Bethel with men's bones (1 Kings 13:2);
etc. Minute events, in themselves unimportant, sometimes come
within the sphere of prophetic revelation, but always in connection
with and subserviency to important transactions affecting the
interests of God's people. Thus when Samuel anointed Saul as the
future king of Israel, he foretold to him the incidents of his
journey homeward (1 Sam. 10:2-7). But this was in order that Saul
might be assured of Samuel's prophetic office, and consequently of
the divine sanction to the transaction. An event in the immediate
future is frequently predicted as a pledge that some prophecy of
more distant fulfilment shall be accomplished. Thus the death of
Eli's two sons in one day was to be a token of the fulfilment of
all the evils threatened against his house. The same end may be
accomplished by a miraculous sign. 1 Kings 13:3; 2 Kings 20:9, 11.
Prophecies of the kind now under consideration are in general very
plain and simple, and their recorded fulfilment is to us a
sufficient interpreter of their meaning.</p>
<h3>II. PROPHECIES RELATING TO THE LAST DAYS.</h3>
<p>3. In Old Testament usage, "the last days," or "the latter days"
("in the latter years," Ezek. 38:8) denote not simply the distant
future, but that future as including the kingdom of the Messiah,
which extends to the consummation of all things Gen. 49:1; Numb.
24:14; Deut. 4:30; 31:29; Isa. 2:2; Jer 23:20; 30:24; 48:47; 49:39;
Ezek. 38:16; Dan. 10:14; Hos. 3:5; Mic. 4:1. We are not, however,
to conceive of these "last days" as totally separated from the
preceding ages. In the plan of God the history of the world
constitutes a whole, all the parts of which are closely connected.
Hence the prophecies relating to the latter days include, more or
less distinctly, the events which precede them, and prepare the way
for them. In such prophecies we are not to look for exhaustive
details. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page609" id=
"page609"></a>{609}</span> They give, as a rule, only general views
relating to the conflicts of God's people and their final triumph.
Where minute incidents are introduced (Psa. 22:18; 69:21; Zech.
9:9; 11:13) it is apparently for the purpose of identifying to
future generations the Messiah as their main subject. See below,
No. 9.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prophecies relating to the days of the Messiah are introduced in
other more indefinite ways, thus: "Behold the days come" (Jer.
23:5; 31:31; etc.): "And it shall come to pass afterward" (Joel
2:28); "In that day" (Isa. 4:2, Jer. 30:8; Ezek. 39:11; Amos 9:11,
and elsewhere); or they are sufficiently indicated by their
contents, as Isa. chaps. 40-66.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These prophecies naturally fall into two classes: those in which
the <i>succession of events</i> is distinctly indicated, and those
which give only <i>general views</i> of the future, without any
clear order of succession.</p>
<p>4. To the first and smaller class belong especially certain of
Daniel's prophecies. The four great monarchies, for example, that
are to bear rule over the earth are symbolized first by a great
image (Dan. chap. 2), then by four beasts rising out of the sea
(Dan. chap. 7). Of these monarchies the fourth, represented by the
legs of iron and feet part of iron and part of clay (Dan. 2:33),
and by the fourth beast with his ten horns (Dan. 7:7), belongs in
part to the latter days of the Messiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth kingdom, represented by the "legs of iron and feet
part of iron and part of clay," is at the beginning "strong as
iron" (chap. 2:40); afterwards it is "partly strong and partly
broken" (ver. 42); it is, moreover, the last great monarchy that
oppresses the world. All these characters point to the Roman
empire, first in its pagan, afterwards in its papal form. From the
nature of the symbol, the prophet sees the <i>whole</i> image
standing till it is smitten in its feet of iron and clay. This does
not mean that the four monarchies are contemporaneous, but that
they constitute one great system of oppression, in which the power
passes successively down from the head to the feet. It is in its
feet that the stone smites it, for it is in this its last form that
the kingdom set up by the God of heaven shall encounter and destroy
it. The toes, part of iron and part of clay, well represent the
kingdoms that grew up out of the old Roman empire, with an
intermixture of the northern nations. These could never unite into
a compact whole, like the original pagan empire, yet they
constituted a continuation of it in a divided form.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page610" id=
"page610"></a>{610}</span>
<p>That the fourth beast again (chap. 7:7-14, 19-28) represents the
same Roman empire appears from the following considerations: (1.)
Both here and in the second chapter a succession of four great
monarchies is represented, of which the first three are admitted to
have been universal. It is altogether reasonable, therefore, to
look for a universal empire in the fourth; but that empire can be
no other than the Roman. (2.) The fourth beast is represented as
the strongest and most terrible of them all, which cannot apply to
any other than the Roman power. (3.) All its characters agree with
those of the Roman empire, and cannot be made to agree with those
of any other power. Those who understand by the little horn of the
fourth beast Antiochus Epiphanes, must consider the fourth beast as
representing the Syrian monarchy, or perhaps Syria and Egypt. But
these belong to the <i>third</i> beast. They are two of the four
divisions into which his empire was broken, and which have just
been represented by the four heads and four wings of the leopard.
(4.) No persecuting power comes after this beast. Its dominion is
destroyed by that of the Messiah, who takes the kingdom and holds
it for ever. This can apply only to the Roman power as perpetuated
in its papal form in the ten horns, which correspond to the ten
toes of the image. Chap. 2:41-43. All the characters of the little
horn agree with those of the papal power; and considering the vast
influence which this has wielded, and still wields, over God's
church, we should naturally expect that it would be included in a
comprehensive view like this of the world's history.</p>
<p>The prophecies of the book of Revelation relative to the great
red dragon&mdash;pagan Rome (chap. 12), the two beasts that
succeeded to his seat and power (chap. 13), and (what is identical
with these two beasts) the woman riding upon a scarlet-colored
beast (chap. 17), are so intimately related to the fourth kingdom
of Daniel, that whatever view be taken of this kingdom must apply
to them also. In these prophetic symbols we have again all the
characters of pagan Rome as continued in papal Rome. Chap. 32, No.
4. To the class of prophecies now under consideration belong also,
according to the most probable principle of interpretation, those
of the seven seals, the seven trumpets included under the last
seal, and the seven vials of the last trumpet (Rev. 6:1
<i>seq.</i>); for in these the succession of events is distinctly
marked.</p>
<p>The <i>numbers</i> of the books of Daniel and Revelation,
particularly the "time and times and dividing of time"&mdash;three
years and a half&mdash;during which the little horn is to have
dominion (Dan. 7:25), and (what is equivalent to this number) the
"forty-and-two months" during which the Gentiles are to tread down
the holy city (Rev. 11:2), and the beast that succeeds to the
dragon is to have power (Rev. 13:5); or in days, the thousand two
hundred and threescore days of the two witnesses (Rev. 11:3), and
of the woman's sojourn in the wilderness (Rev. 12:6), have
furnished for centuries <span class="pagenum"><a name="page611" id=
"page611"></a>{611}</span> matter of curious speculation and
computation, upon the assumption that a day here represents a year
(Chap. 35, No. 9); but hitherto history has not verified the
results as to time which the students of these prophecies have
given. The failure of their computations might have been
anticipated. It seems to be the plan of God to throw such a vail
over even exact dates of prophecy, that their place in a
chronological chart of history cannot be accurately marked out
beforehand. Either the time <i>from</i> which the reckoning is to
proceed, or the symbolism of the dates, or the place which the
whole series holds in relation to other prophecies, is left in
obscurity. The experience of those who have busied themselves with
the computation of these dates teaches, not that we should wholly
withdraw ourselves from inquiries of this kind, but that to pursue
them in a confident and dogmatic spirit, as if we had been admitted
to the council-chamber of heaven, and had there learned the exact
day and hour on which the papal throne must fall, or our Lord
reappear on earth, is a mark, not of wisdom, but of weakness and
folly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. In the <i>second</i> and larger class of prophecies relating
to the last days, the element of time, and especially that of
succession in time, is either wholly wanting, or is indicated in
only a vague and general way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples of this class of prophecies are almost innumerable. A
remarkable specimen is found in the fourth chapter of Isaiah,
viewed in connection with the preceding context. The prophet's
position is that of his own day. He writes at a time when heavy
calamities are impending over his countrymen. With these calamities
he begins: "Behold the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from
Judah and Jerusalem the stay and the staff, the whole stay of
bread, and the whole stay of water, the mighty man, and the man of
war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor,
and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator." Chap. 3:1-3.
So he proceeds, in terms which must apply primarily to the
Babylonish captivity, to the end of the third chapter, which closes
with the terrible denunciation: "Thy men shall fall by the sword,
and thy mighty men in war. And her gates shall lament and mourn;
and she, being desolate, shall sit upon the ground" (ver. 25, 26).
To complete the picture of desolation, it is added in the beginning
of the fourth chapter: "And in that day seven women shall take hold
of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own
apparel: only let us be called by thy name to take away our
reproach." The obvious meaning of this last threatening is, that
the mass of the men shall perish in war, so that the surviving
women cannot find husbands. Seven of them, therefore, ask of one
man <span class="pagenum"><a name="page612" id=
"page612"></a>{612}</span> the privilege of being called each his
wife, while they offer to forego all the usual advantages of that
relation. Thus far the prophet proceeds in a strain of threatening.
But now, with the single formula, "in that day," there is a sudden
transition to promise, and promise of such a character that it must
cover the whole future period of the Messiah's kingdom: "In that
day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the
fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are
escaped of Israel" (chap. 4:2); and so he goes on to describe the
glory of the latter days, when the Lord, having "purged the blood
of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and
by the spirit of burning," "will create upon every dwelling-place
of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,
and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
shall be a defence" (ver. 4, 5). Here we have, in a certain sense,
an indication of time, but it is wholly indefinite. No date is
given for the fulfilment of the prophecy, nor any exact
chronological order of succession. The prophet began with the
judgments that impended over his countrymen. He ends with the full
glory of the Messiah's reign, without any indication of the
intervening interval of time.</p>
<p>Another striking example is furnished by the eleventh chapter of
Isaiah in connection with the preceding context. The tenth chapter
of Isaiah contains an account of the Assyrian monarch's progress
through the land of Judea, ending with a figurative account of his
overthrow: "Behold the Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall lop the bough
with terror; and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and
the haughty shall be humbled. And he shall cut down the thickets of
the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one" (ver.
33, 34). Immediately upon this prediction, and with reference to
the Assyrian bough and the thickets of Lebanon&mdash;Sennacherib
with his host&mdash;that have been hewn down, follows a prophecy of
the Messiah's advent: "And there shall come forth a rod out of the
stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots." Chap.
11:1. The prophet represents these two events, the overthrow of the
Assyrian and the advent of the Messiah, as so connected that the
latter follows as a natural sequel to the former, passing over in
silence the many intervening centuries. He represents, again, the
Messiah's kingdom as one of continuous victorious progress, till
"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the
waters cover the sea," without pausing to indicate any intervening
period of darkness and depression.</p>
<p>Still a third pure specimen of this form of prophecy occurs in
the fifty-ninth and sixtieth chapters of Isaiah. The former of
these two chapters is occupied with a description in very dark
lines of the sins of God's covenant people (ver. 1-15), and of
God's interposition in awful majesty to vindicate his own cause
(ver. 16-21). Immediately upon this follows, in the sixtieth
chapter, a vision of the latter-day glory that has no parallel in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page613" id=
"page613"></a>{613}</span> the Old Testament for brightness,
extending down to the full establishment of the millennial age. But
<i>when</i> shall these things be? How long shall the present age
of iniquity endure? And when Jehovah appears to save the cause of
truth and righteousness, shall it be by a single interposition or a
series of interpositions? If by the latter, how widely shall they
be separated, and what dark scenes shall intervene? When shall the
promised Redeemer appear, and how long shall his work be in
progress before that blessed consummation contained in the promise:
"Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days
of thy mourning shall be ended?" On all these points which involve
the element of time the prophecy maintains a majestic silence. The
closing promise indeed is: "I the Lord will hasten it in his time;"
but with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand
years as one day. The time for the consummation of God's plan to
rescue this apostate world from the dominion of Satan&mdash;how
many slowly revolving centuries may it include, and what fierce and
bloody assaults of the adversary, compelling God's suffering people
to cry out: "O Lord, how long!"</p>
<p>The whole of the prophecy of Joel belongs to the class now under
consideration. It begins with impending judgments, and closes with
the conflict and triumph of the last times: "Multitudes, multitudes
in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord is near in the
valley of decision. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the
stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord also shall roar out of
Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the
earth shall shake; but the Lord shall be the hope of his people,
and the strength of the children of Israel. So shall ye know that I
am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain; then shall
Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her
any more." Chap. 3:14-17.</p>
<p>Many more examples might be adduced from the other prophets, but
the above will be sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. But let no one infer, from this absence of dates and of the
exact succession of events, that the view which the prophet gives
of the future is loose and confused. Times and successions belong
rather to the outward machinery of God's providential government.
They are, so to speak, the wheels and bands and shafts which
connect the different movements. But the <i>perpetual living
power</i> that dwells in the church is above all time and
succession. In this lies the guarantee of her final triumph, and
with this the prophets are mainly occupied. They take the deepest
view of the progress of God's kingdom, for <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page614" id="page614"></a>{614}</span> they
unfold to our view the indestructible divine life and power which
animate it throughout, and which are steadily bearing it onward
towards its final destiny&mdash;victory complete and eternal over
all the powers of darkness. If we examine more particularly the
manner in which the prophets of the Old Testament represent the
future of the kingdom of heaven, we shall find that it has its
foundation in the <i>unity</i> of the plan of redemption, the
<i>end</i> towards which it is tending, the <i>indications</i> of
that end which are perpetually given in its progress, and the fact
that <i>the end itself is the chief object of interest</i> in
prophetic vision.</p>
<p>(1.) The <i>unity</i> of the plan of redemption lies not in its
times and seasons, but in the higher connections of cause and
effect, which, under God's supernatural presence and agency, bind
the whole together laterally, so to speak, as well as backward and
forward. It may be compared to the unity of a web, in which each
thread of the warp extends from its beginning to its end, and each
thread of the woof from one margin to the other; so that every part
of the texture is connected with every other part without respect
to nearness or distance. So in the plan of redemption, events
thousands of years apart and taking place in regions thousands of
miles from each other, are as really connected as if they belonged
to the same year and country. And since they are thus connected in
God's plan, it is natural that prophecy should exhibit them in this
connection, passing over, it may be, many centuries in silence; for
it is the <i>salient points</i> of the church's future history, the
great crises in the process of her development, that the spirit of
inspiration will naturally bring to view. Prophecy relating to the
last times is not a <i>map</i>, in which the distance from one
point to another, with all the intervening mountains, rivers, and
towns, is accurately marked; but rather a <i>prospective view</i>,
which exhibits only the great features of the region that lies
before the traveller. He sees far off in the horizon the goodly
mountains rising one behind another, and bathed in the pure light
of heaven, with no ability to discern, much less to measure, the
intervening valleys and plains. Nay more, mountain <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page615" id="page615"></a>{615}</span> ranges
that are widely separated may appear to his eye as one and
indivisible.</p>
<p>(2.) The plan of redemption has not only complete unity, but
<i>continual progress towards a high end</i>. It may be compared to
a majestic river, fed by thousands of perennial springs, that
cannot stay a moment in its course towards the ocean. Its path is
not always straight, but it is always onward. Its current is not
always rapid and broken, for it is not always obstructed.
Sometimes, like the Arar described by C&aelig;sar, it winds through
level plains with a current so gentle and noiseless, that the eye
cannot discern its direction. Then it plunges over some Niagara,
roaring, boiling, and foaming, and shaking the very earth with its
mighty cataracts. But it <i>has</i> all the power in the level
meadows that it <i>manifests</i> on the fearful brink of the
precipice. To arrest its current in one place is as impossible as
in the other. Resistance cannot overcome its strength, but only
bring it to view. Let any number of Titans build up ever so high a
wall across the level meadow, and the stream, every particle of
which is pressed forward by an inward force, will quietly rise
above their vain rampart, and then it will begin to thunder. Since
then God's kingdom&mdash;this river of God that is full of
water&mdash;is continually tending towards a high end, and since
every event of his providence contributes something towards its
progress, what wonder if we find in prophecy events separated by
many centuries of time immediately connected as cause and effect?
Does the prophet predict the overthrow of Sennacherib's army, or
the coming desolation of Jerusalem by the Chaldean armies; he
connects these calamities immediately with the advent of Christ,
for this is the end towards which they look. Desolating judgments
prepare the way for the King of glory to appear. After the storm of
thunder and hail there follows a serene light, "as the light of the
morning when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the
tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after
rain." The mind of the inspired bard hastens onward towards the
glorious <i>end</i> of God's judgments, without <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page616" id="page616"></a>{616}</span> pausing
to give us, what it is not necessary that we should know, the
chronological distance of that end.</p>
<p>(3.) The progress of God's kingdom gives continual
<i>indications of the end</i> towards which it is tending. The
first great interposition of God in behalf of Israel contained in
itself a pledge of all needful help for the future, and thus of a
final triumph in the future; for it was a manifestation of both
God's absolute power to save his people, and his absolute purpose
to save them. The full idea embodied in this interposition is
summed up in the closing words of their triumphal song on the shore
of the Red sea: "<i>The Lord shall reign for ever and ever</i>."
What was true of this deliverance was true of every subsequent
deliverance. In each of them separately, and in the whole of them
collectively, lay the promise: "Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye
men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer,
the Holy One of Israel. Behold I will make thee [make thee to be] a
new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the
mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.
Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the
whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord,
and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel." Isa. 41:14-16.</p>
<p>The <i>chastisements</i>, moreover, which God inflicted on the
covenant people through the temporary ascendency of their enemies,
and in other ways, gave in like manner indications of a final
triumph of the cause of truth and righteousness. However great
their severity, they were always so ordered that God's people were
<i>never destroyed, but always purified</i> by their power, and
thus the way was prepared for their future enlargement. This
purifying tendency the divinely illumined eye of the Hebrew prophet
clearly discerned. What wonder, then, that he should have
constantly connected with present or impending judgments glorious
promises respecting the future. The destruction of Sennacherib's
army by the destroying angel, and afterwards of Jerusalem itself by
the Chaldean armies&mdash;the former event so joyous in its outward
form, the latter so <span class="pagenum"><a name="page617" id=
"page617"></a>{617}</span> sad&mdash;these were both alike to the
prophet's vision parts of the preparation through which God was
carrying his people for the future glory and blessedness of the
latter days. He accordingly connected both with bright visions of
the future, without pausing to notice the intervening centuries,
respecting the duration of which he had no commission to speak.</p>
<p>(4.) <i>The end itself</i> towards which the plan of redemption
tends <i>is the chief object of interest</i> in prophetic
representation. To nourish the faith and hope of the church, to
invigorate her in her present struggles by the assurance of final
victory&mdash;this, and not the gratification of a prurient
curiosity respecting the exact dates of "times and seasons," is the
main design of prophecy. That it has other subordinate ends need
not be denied. It challenges for itself the attribute of
omniscience, and its fulfilment is, to those who live after it, a
proof of the validity of its claim. But to become absorbed in
calculations beforehand respecting its dates is to elevate the
subordinate and circumstantial in prophecy to the place of the
essential. The bright <i>end</i> of the present conflict with the
powers of darkness is what prophetic vision is continually
presenting for our encouragement. To those who love God, this is
the point of chief interest; and accordingly the prophets make it,
not the exact number of years that is to elapse before the final
consummation with the details of their history, the prominent
point. Some great crises in the church's history are indicated so
clearly that they who can discern "the signs of the times" may
understand beforehand that they are near. The general expectation
of the Messiah's advent at the time when he actually appeared had
its foundation in a sober comparison of the prophecies with the
existing condition of the covenant people. The present universal
belief among Christians that the time for the final overthrow of
the triple league between Satan, wicked kings, and wicked priests
for the suppression of the gospel is at hand rests, we doubt not,
on the same solid ground. But farther than this we cannot go. We
cannot say that it shall be in such a year of the present century,
or even in the century, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page618"
id="page618"></a>{618}</span> harmony with the true spirit of
prophecy. It is enough for us to know that God "will hasten it in
his time"&mdash;that the victory is certain, and that every
believer from Abel to the trump of the archangel shall have his
share in it.</p>
<h3>III. THE QUESTION OF DOUBLE SENSE.</h3>
<p>7. The so-called <i>double sense</i> of Scripture, especially of
prophecy, concerning which there has been so much discussion among
biblical writers, must be distinguished from the double sense of
pure allegory, which all admit. In allegory, the first or literal
meaning is only a cover for the higher spiritual sense, which alone
is of importance. That we may have a true example of double sense,
the obvious literal meaning must have its own proper significance,
irrespective of the higher sense belonging to it, and this higher
sense must be intended by the Spirit of inspiration. The question
now to be considered is: Do such examples occur in Scripture, by
whatever term we may choose to designate them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To avoid logomachy, arising from the use of the same phrase in
different senses, we prefer the expression <i>literal</i> and
<i>typical sense</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>8. If, as has been shown above (chap. 37, No. 4), examples of
<i>historic types</i> are found in the Old Testament, these contain
a twofold sense. The priesthood of Melchizedek and the transactions
between him and Abraham were true historic realities, having their
own proper office and meaning. Yet the word of inspiration teaches
us that the circumstances connected with Melchizedek's priesthood
and his meeting with Abraham were intended by God to shadow forth
the higher priesthood of Melchizedek's great Antitype. He brought
forth bread and wine, the very symbols that should afterwards
represent Christ crucified as our spiritual food and drink, blessed
him that had the promises, and received at his hand tithes of all
(Gen. 14:18-20), thus exercising the prerogatives of one higher
than Abraham, and consequently higher than all his posterity. Heb.
7:4-10. In the intention of the Holy Ghost, the higher typical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page619" id=
"page619"></a>{619}</span> meaning lay in this transaction from the
beginning, but it was not revealed to the apprehension of believers
till the Christian dispensation had begun. So also the rest of the
covenant people in the land of Canaan is represented in the New
Testament as typical of the true heavenly rest. Heb. 4:7-11. Other
examples might be adduced, but these will serve as an illustration
of the principle now under consideration.</p>
<p>9. The most striking examples of a literal covering a typical
meaning are furnished by the so-called <i>Messianic psalms</i>, a
part of which describe the victories and universal dominion of a
mighty King whom Jehovah himself establishes on Zion to reign there
for ever (Psalms 2, 45, 72, 110, etc.); another part, the deep
afflictions of a mighty Sufferer and his subsequent deliverance,
which has for its result the conversion of all nations to the
service of Jehovah. Psalms 22, 40, 69, 109, etc. That such psalms
as the second and seventy-second, the twenty-second, fortieth, and
sixty-ninth (not to mention others), have a true reference to
Christ's person and work, cannot be denied without imputing either
error or fraud to the writers of the New Testament. Nay more, our
Lord himself said, after his resurrection: "These are the words
which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things
must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in
the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me" (Luke 24:44);
whence we learn that it was our Lord's custom to refer to the
psalms as containing prophecies of himself. If the psalms, when
legitimately interpreted, contain no such prophecies, then, when
the writers of the New Testament quoted them as referring to
Christ, they either believed that they were making a true
application of them according to the mind of the Holy Spirit, or
they simply accommodated themselves to what they knew to be the
groundless prejudices of the age. Upon the former supposition they
were in error; upon the latter, they were guilty of fraud. Such is
the dishonor which the modern principles of rationalism put upon
the word of God. In the interpretation of these psalms, then, we
must assume as a fundamental <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page620" id="page620"></a>{620}</span> truth that they contain a
true reference to Christ. The only question is, whether they
contain a lower reference also.</p>
<p>(1.) One class of interpreters understand these psalms simply of
Christ; that is, they assume that the writer speaks wholly in the
name of Christ, without reference to himself or any merely human
personage. There are psalms&mdash;the hundred and tenth, for
example&mdash;that may be very well explained in this way. The
opening words of that psalm&mdash;"The Lord said unto my
lord"&mdash;seem to exclude David as the subject, and it is
difficult to see in what sense David could speak of himself as made
by a divine oath "a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek"
(ver. 4). But in the attempt to carry this principle consistently
through all the Messianic psalms, one meets with serious
difficulties. They contain, at least some of them, historic
allusions of a character so marked and circumstantial that it is
hard to believe that the writer had not in view his own personal
situation. In some of them, moreover, the writer makes confession
to God of his sins. Psa. 40:12; 69:5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They who apply these psalms exclusively to Christ assume that
these confessions of sin are made in a <i>vicarious</i> way, the
Messiah assuming the character of a sinner because "the Lord hath
laid on him the iniquities of us all." Isa. 53:6. But the form of
these confessions forbids such an interpretation. When the psalmist
says: "Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me;" "O God, thou
knowest my foolishness, and my sins are not hid from thee," we
cannot understand such language of any thing else than personal
sinfulness. It is true that the Messiah bore our iniquities, and
that God "made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;" but the
Saviour nowhere speaks or can speak of "mine iniquities," "my
foolishness," and "my sins."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(2.) According to another class of interpreters, the subject of
these psalms, particularly of those which describe the Messiah as a
sufferer, is an <i>ideal personage</i>, namely, the congregation of
the righteous considered not separately from Christ, but in Christ
their head; or, which amounts to the same thing, Christ considered,
not in his simple personality apart from the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page621" id="page621"></a>{621}</span> church,
but Christ with his body the church. The contents of these psalms
are then applied, <i>according to their nature</i>, to Christ
alone, to believers alone who are his members, or to Christ in the
fullest sense and believers in a subordinate sense. Much might be
said in favor of this view; yet it labors under the difficulty
already indicated, that one cannot well read the psalms in
question, with their marked historic allusions, without the
conviction that the author had in view&mdash;not indirectly, but
immediately&mdash;his own personal situation.</p>
<p>(3.) There remains a third, and perhaps preferable view, which
may be called the <i>typical view</i>, maintained, as is well
known, by Melanchthon, Calvin, and many later expositors. This
begins with the well-established principle that David (in a less
eminent degree his successors also on the throne, so far as they
were true to their office) was a divinely-constituted type of the
Messiah, not only in his office as the earthly head of God's
kingdom, but in the events of his history also; that the psalms in
question, whether they describe his victorious might or his deep
suffering at the hand of his enemies, had a true historic origin;
that their first and immediate reference was to the writer's own
situation and the events which befell him; but that, under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, he was carried beyond himself to
describe the office and history of the Messiah; that consequently
these psalms have a lower fulfilment in David the type (the
seventy-second in Solomon), and a higher in Christ the
Antitype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second psalm, for example, which describes the vain
conspiracy of the heathen rulers against the Lord's anointed king,
and God's purpose to give him the uttermost ends of the earth for
his possession, may have had its occasion in the combination of the
surrounding heathen nations against David. In the victorious might
with which God endowed him, it had a lower fulfilment; and this
was, so to speak, the first sheaf of the harvest of victories that
was to follow. It was an earnest and pledge of the complete
fulfilment of the psalm in Christ, in whom alone the promise made
to David: "Thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for
ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever" (2 Sam.
7:16), could have its real accomplishment. Luke 1: 32, 33.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page622" id=
"page622"></a>{622}</span>
<p>The second class of psalms, of which the twenty-second is a
well-known example, may have had, in like manner, a true historic
origin. When the psalmist began with the exclamation: "My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?" he may have had immediate
reference to his own distressed condition. But since he was the
divinely appointed head of the line of kings which should end in
Christ, and was thus in his office a type of Christ, God had so
ordered the circumstances of his history as to shadow forth in them
the sufferings and final triumph of the Messiah. Writing under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, he was led, through these
circumstances, to say many things which applied to himself only in
a lower and often figurative sense, but which were appointed to
have a complete fulfilment in Christ his Antitype (Psa. 22:1, 7, 8,
14, 15, 16, 18; 40:6-10; 69:4, 7-9, 21; 109:1-20), and which point
to Christ as the chief subject of the prophecies.</p>
<p>How far the psalmist understood this higher reference of his
words is a question difficult to be determined. With regard to the
sixteenth psalm, the apostle Peter tells us that David, "being a
prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that
of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise
up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before, spake of the
resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither
his flesh did see corruption" (Acts 2:30, 31); whence we infer that
in penning this psalm David was conscious of its higher application
to Christ. The spirit of the New Testament quotations from the
psalms indicates that he had a deeper insight into the prophetic
meaning of his words than many modern expositors are willing to
admit. But however this may be, the Spirit of inspiration had in
view the fulfilment of these psalms in Christ; and his intention,
clearly revealed to us in the New Testament, is our rule of
interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>10. Different from the above literal and typical sense, yet
closely related to it in principle, is that of the <i>progressive
fulfilment</i> of prophecy, which has a wide application in the
interpretation of those prophecies which relate to the last days.
By the progressive fulfilment of prophecy is meant, a fulfilment
not exhaustively accomplished at one particular era or crisis in
the church's history, but successively from age to age; a
fulfilment repeated, it may be, many times, and ending only with
the final consummation of the Messiah's kingdom. An undeniable
example of such a prophecy is God's message by Isaiah to the
covenant people: "Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page623" id="page623"></a>{623}</span> not,"
etc, with the threatened desolation that should follow (chap.
6:9-13). This prophecy had a true fulfilment in the ancient Jewish
people before the Babylonish captivity. For their blindness of mind
and hardness of heart, they were given over to the power of
Nebuchadnezzar, who wasted their land, destroyed their city and
temple, and carried the remnant of the people into captivity. But
the same prophecy had, in both its parts, a more awful fulfilment
in the generation of Jews who rejected and crucified our Lord, and
were destroyed with their city and temple by the armies of Rome
(Matt. 13:14, 15; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; John 12:39-41; Acts
28:25-27; Rom. 11:8); and its fulfilment is yet in progress. Joel's
prophecy of the outpouring of the Spirit in the last days upon all
flesh, with the mighty accompanying judgments (chap. 2: 28-32), and
Amos' prediction of the raising up of David's fallen tabernacle
(chap. 9:11, 12), had both their <i>initial</i> fulfilment in the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and the
triumphs of the gospel that followed. Acts 2:16-21; 15:16, 17. But
the blessings which they promised were not exhausted in the
apostolic age. The church has had rich instalments of them, but
richer still are reserved for the future of millennial glory. A
large part of the prophecies of the Old Testament indicate in their
very structure that they are not to be understood of particular
events, but of the development of God's kingdom from age to age.
The reader may take, as a single example among many others, the
prediction of Isaiah and Micah concerning the establishment of the
Lord's house in the last days in the top of the mountains, the
resort of all nations to it, and the universal peace that shall
follow. Isa. 2:2-4; Micah 4:1-4. That particularism which seeks for
the fulfilment of every prophecy in some one specific event of
history must go widely astray in its interpretation of
Scripture.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page624" id=
"page624"></a>{624}</span>
<h3>IV. THE QUESTION OF LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE MEANING.</h3>
<p>11. On this question expositors are, as is well known, much
divided; one class adopting, as far as possible, the literal
meaning of the prophetic announcements, the other freely employing
the principle of figurative interpretation. A full discussion of
the claims of these two methods of interpretation, on which so many
volumes have been written, would far exceed the limits of the
present work. All that can be done is, to indicate some
well-established principles which may help to guide the biblical
student in the study of prophecy.</p>
<p>12. We begin by calling attention to the <i>representative
use</i> which the Old Testament prophets make of the events of the
<i>past history of Israel</i>; that is, to their habit of
representing the future under the imagery of this history. When
Israel journeyed from Egypt to Palestine through the wilderness of
Arabia, God dried up the tongue of the Egyptian sea before the
people, guided them miraculously by the cloudy pillar, fed them
with manna, made streams of water to burst forth from the rock for
their refreshment, and finally divided the waters of the Jordan to
give them a passage into the promised land. This primitive history
of Israel furnishes for the prophets who lived in later ages a rich
treasury of images which it would be absurd to interpret in a
literal way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus Isaiah, speaking of the future gathering together of the
outcasts of Israel and the dispersed of Judah from the four corners
of the earth (chap. 11:11, 12), says: "And the Lord shall utterly
destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea, and with his mighty wind
shall he shake his hand over the river [the Euphrates], and shall
smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry shod" (ver.
15). To suppose that the prophet foretells a literal repetition of
the miracles wrought upon the Red sea and the Jordan is unnecessary
and most improbable. The meaning is, that God shall remove all
obstacles which hinder the return of his people to their own land,
as he originally removed all obstacles which opposed their entrance
into it. This is, indeed, the very idea of the following verse:
"And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which
shall <span class="pagenum"><a name="page625" id=
"page625"></a>{625}</span> be left, from Assyria; like as it was to
Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt."</p>
<p>Again, the prophet foretells that in the latter day glory "the
Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and upon
her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a
flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence."
Isa. 4:5. Here "the figurative reference is to the pillar of cloud
and the pillar of fire in which the Lord went before the Israelites
in the wilderness, and to the glory which rested upon the
tabernacle." Henderson. God will give to his church in the latter
day that which the pillar of cloud and of fire signified, his
glorious presence and protection. A literal repetition of the
miracle is not to be thought of.</p>
<p>Once more, God promises to his weary people, on their pilgrimage
to Zion, that "in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
streams in the desert" (Isa. 35:6, and often elsewhere), with
obvious allusion to the miraculous supplies of water furnished to
the Israelites in their journey through the Arabian desert to the
land of Canaan. The water here promised is the water of life, and
not literal fountains in the desert. Upon the same principle are we
to interpret the river that flows out from under the threshold of
the temple, and flows down eastward to the Dead sea, growing
broader and deeper in its course, and imparting life to everything
which comes within its influence. Ezek. 47:1-12, and compare Psa.
46:4; Joel 3:18; Zech. 14:8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13. The same representative use is made by the prophets of the
<i>institutions of the Mosaic economy</i>. One of their offices
was, to foretell the extension of the true religion over all the
earth; the conversion of all nations to the faith of the covenant
people, and their peaceful subjection to Jehovah who reigned in
Zion. <i>In what form</i> should this be done while the theocracy
was yet in full force? The disclosure of God's purpose to abolish
this theocracy in the interest of a simpler and more spiritual
dispensation, which should know no distinction between Jews and
Gentiles, would have been a premature act. It would, so far as we
can judge, have led to much error and misapprehension; and it must
have had the effect of disparaging the existing economy before the
world was prepared to receive any thing better in its place. God,
therefore, allowed his prophets to portray the glories of the
latter day, when all nations should come to the knowledge and
obedience of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page626" id=
"page626"></a>{626}</span> truth, <i>under the forms of the Jewish
dispensation</i>, with its temple, sacrifices, and solemn
festivals.</p>
<p>A striking example is the bright portraiture of two contemporary
prophets: "But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the
mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top
of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and
people [Hebrew <i>peoples</i>, that is, as Isaiah, <i>all the
nations</i>] shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and
say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the
house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we
will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many
people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into
pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man
under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them
afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it." Micah
4:1-4, compared with Isa. 2:2-4. The temple at Jerusalem, with its
altar and priesthood, was the central point of the old theocracy.
There all the sacrifices were to be offered, there was the seat of
royal authority, and consequently of public justice, and thither
all the males among the people were required to repair three times
a year at the great national festivals. Deut. 16:16. A Jew could
conceive of the conversion of all nations only in the form of their
subjecting themselves to the theocracy, and coming up to Jerusalem
for worship and the administration of justice. Accordingly the
Spirit of prophecy here represents the mountain of the Lord's house
as "established in the top of the mountains," a conspicuous object
to all nations, who resort thither for worship, submit themselves
to the authority of the great king who reigns there, and thus have
universal peace and happiness. To insist on the literal
interpretation of these words is contrary to the general analogy of
prophecy. It is an attempt to bring back the outward sensuous form
of the kingdom of heaven which the gospel dispensation has
abolished.</p>
<p>There is another celebrated passage in Zechariah (14:16-21)
which is intensely Jewish in its costume. After describing the
judgments of God upon the nations that have fought against
Jerusalem, the prophet goes on to say: "And it shall come to pass
that every one that is left of all the nations which came against
Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to year to worship the King,
the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it
shall be, that whoso will not come up, of all the families of the
earth, unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even
upon them shall be no rain. And if the family of Egypt go not up,
and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague,
wherewith the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page627" id=
"page627"></a>{627}</span> Lord will smite the heathen that come
not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. This shall be the
punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come
not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. In that day there shall be
upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots
in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar. Yea,
every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord
of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them
and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the
Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts." The prophet's care to
include "all the families of the earth" in this ordinance is very
noticeable. Whatever nation refuses to observe it shall have no
rain. But, recollecting that for Egypt this can be no punishment,
he appoints for that country the plague instead of the absence of
rain. Is it so, then, that in the last days all the families of the
earth are to go up year by year to worship at Jerusalem? If so,
they are to <i>sacrifice</i> also; for the prophecy is a
homogeneous whole, of which, if the beginning is to be understood
literally, so is the end also. The reference is to the
<i>peace-offerings</i> of the people, on which, after certain
prescribed portions had been burned on the altar, the offerer
feasted with his friends; and a special provision is made for the
multitude of these sacrifices. "Every pot in Judah and Jerusalem,"
as well as "the pots in the Lord's house," "shall be holiness unto
the Lord of hosts," that it may be used for boiling the flesh of
the peace-offerings, precisely as we find done in the days of Eli.
1 Sam. 2:13-16. But all sacrifices are done away for ever in
Christ. Heb. 10:10-18. This part of the prophecy must clearly be
understood figuratively, and therefore the whole. The future
reception of the true religion by all nations is foretold under the
symbols of the Mosaic economy, with its ritual, its yearly feasts,
and its central place of worship. For this principle of
interpretation we have the warrant of the New Testament. Did the
law of Moses prescribe a literal priesthood with literal
sacrifices; believers, under the new dispensation, are a spiritual
priesthood, presenting their bodies as "living sacrifices." Rom.
12:1; 1 Pet. 2:5. Did the Mosaic economy have a central metropolis,
a literal Zion, whither all the tribes went up; believers in Christ
have come to the spiritual "Mount Zion" which this shadowed forth,
where the great Antitype of David reigns, that all nations may
resort to him, and he may teach them his laws.</p>
<p>Upon the same principle, as well as for other very obvious
reasons (see chaps. 42:15-20; 45:1-8; 47:1-12, and the whole of
chap. 48), Ezekiel's minute description of a New Jerusalem, with
its territory, its temple, and its Jewish appointments (chaps.
40-48), is to be understood not literally but figuratively. This
temple has also its Levitical priesthood, its altar, and its
sacrifices (chap. 43:13-27), all which are done away in Christ.
There are other passages kindred to the above which it is not
necessary to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page628" id=
"page628"></a>{628}</span> consider separately, as they all come
under the same general principle of interpretation.</p>
<p>14. In the classes of prophecies that have been considered, the
principle of figurative interpretation can be maintained upon solid
grounds. But it would be wrong to press it as of universal and
exclusive application. Where no reasons to the contrary exist, the
literal interpretation, as the most natural and obvious, deserves
the preference. To draw the limits between the literal and the
figurative in prophecy is difficult, and in some cases impossible.
In this respect it has pleased the wisdom of God that a vail should
rest on some unfulfilled predictions which his own hand alone has
power to remove. There are two questions, especially, respecting
which interpreters have long been divided, and will probably
continue to be divided, till God himself shall decide them. The
first is that of the <i>literal restoration</i> of the Jews to the
promised land; the second, that of <i>our Lord's personal reign on
earth</i> during the promised age of millennial glory. To enter
upon the full discussion of either would require a volume. We must
dismiss both with some brief hints.</p>
<p>15. The original promise to Abraham included the grant of the
land of Canaan to him and his seed "for an everlasting possession."
Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8; 26:3; 28:13. It is expressed in the
plainest terms, the boundaries of the promised territory are
defined, and the nations inhabiting it enumerated (Gen. 15:18-21);
in a word, every thing indicates the literal as the true
interpretation. The remarkable words of the Saviour: "And they
shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive
into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled" (Luke
21:24), have had a literal fulfilment in the awful judgments which
they foretell; and it seems reasonable to believe that the promise
implied in the last clause, "<i>until the times of the Gentiles be
fulfilled</i>" shall have a literal fulfilment also in their
repossession of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. The wonderful
preservation of the Jewish <span class="pagenum"><a name="page629"
id="page629"></a>{629}</span> nation through so many centuries of
dispersion points in the same direction. All these things, taken in
connection with the numerous and very explicit prophecies of their
captivity and dispersion for their sins, and their subsequent
restoration upon repentance (Lev. chap. 26; Deut. chaps, 28-30: 1
Kings 8:46-50; Isa. chaps. 6, 11, 66; Jer. chaps. 30, 31; Ezek.
chaps. 36-39; Hosea 1:10, 11; Joel. chap. 3; Amos chap. 9; Micah
7:8-20; Zeph. 3:8-20), seem to warrant the expectation of a literal
fulfilment hereafter of the promise made to Abraham that his seed
should inherit the land of Canaan for ever.</p>
<p>16. That Christ will come again in glory to raise the dead,
change the living, and judge all nations, is a fundamental article
of the Christian faith. But the doctrine "that the fleshly and
sublunary state is not to terminate with the coming of Christ, but
to be then set up in a new form; when, with his glorified saints,
the Redeemer will reign in person on the throne of David at
Jerusalem for a thousand years, over a world of men yet in the
flesh, eating and drinking, planting and building, marrying and
giving in marriage, under this mysterious sway" (Brown on the
Second Advent, who correctly states the fundamental principle of
the system), cannot lay claim to an irrefragable basis of
scriptural teaching. The arguments relied on by its advocates are
drawn in part from the very passages that have been considered
above (Micah 4:1-4; Zech. 14:16-21). How little support the theory
derives from these passages, when fairly interpreted, we have seen.
Nor is it favored by the references to our Lord's second coming in
the gospels and epistles, for they clearly connect it with the
final consummation of all things.</p>
<p>Our Saviour says: "The hour is coming, in the which all that are
in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that
have done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that have
done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." John 5:28, 29. He
plainly represents these two resurrections as simultaneous; nor is
there in the record of his words any hint of a partial resurrection
ages before the reign of death in this world shall close. The
resurrection "<i>at the last trump</i>" to which the apostle Paul
refers (1 Cor. chap. 15; 1 Thess. 4:13-18; 2 Thess. 1:7-10) is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page630" id=
"page630"></a>{630}</span> universal. It expressly includes all the
dead in Christ and the change of all Christ's living disciples. If
nothing is said of the resurrection of the wicked, it is because
the apostle has in mind only the "resurrection of life," and has no
occasion to speak of the simultaneous "resurrection of damnation"
which the Saviour himself connects with it. This resurrection at
the last trump is also the annihilation of the reign of death; for
when it happens, "then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory." 1 Cor. 15:54. But "the
last enemy that shall be destroyed is death," and "then cometh the
end." 1 Cor. 15:24-26.</p>
<p>The Saviour teaches, moreover, that his personal presence on
earth is inconsistent with the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. "It
is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away the
Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him
unto you." John 16:7. It is expedient, doubtless, because the
dispensation of the Spirit is better adapted to our present state
of flesh and blood than his personal presence could be. This
dispensation of the Spirit must, from the nature of the case, be
continued in its full force throughout the millennial era, when the
generations of men will succeed each other as at present. But the
New Testament knows nothing of the dispensation of the Holy Spirit
existing contemporaneously with Christ's personal reign on earth.
Its constant doctrine is that the salvation of men is effected by
<i>Christ's intercession in heaven</i> conjointly with <i>the gift
of the Holy Spirit on earth</i>.</p>
<p>The passage mainly relied upon by the advocates of this theory
is the twentieth chapter of the book of Revelation, which speaks of
the first and second resurrection. But the <i>first</i>
resurrection there described cannot be identical with the
resurrection described by Paul at our Lord's advent. The
resurrection described by Paul includes in express terms <i>all</i>
the righteous, whereas this first resurrection of the Apocalypse is
restricted to a certain class, namely, the martyrs and confessors
for Christ's sake (ver. 4), while the rest of the dead live not
till the thousand years are over (ver. 5). Then there is a general
resurrection (ver. 11-15), which, from its very terms, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page631" id="page631"></a>{631}</span> includes
<i>the righteous and the wicked</i>; for among the books then
opened is "the book of life." The risen dead are "judged every man
according to his works," and all whose names are not found in the
book of life are cast into the lake of fire. At the same time death
and hell (Hades), personified as two enemies of the human race, are
cast into the lake of fire, and thus "death, the last enemy, is
destroyed," and "death is swallowed up in victory." 1 Cor. 15:26,
54. <i>This</i> is the resurrection which takes place upon our
Lord's advent at the last trump, not a thousand years after his
advent; the resurrection and judgment, when the wicked "shall go
away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life
eternal." We venture not to interpret the meaning of the first
resurrection, believing that it is one of the mysteries which God
alone will reveal in its fulfilment. But whether it should be taken
literally or figuratively, after the analogy of the resurrection of
the two witnesses (chap. 11:11), it does not seem reasonable to
build upon this obscure and difficult passage a doctrine respecting
our Lord's pre-millennial advent and personal reign on earth which
is so decidedly at variance with the general tenor of
Scripture.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<h3>QUOTATIONS FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT IN THE NEW.</h3>
<p>1. As it respects inspiration, and consequent infallible
authority, the quotations of the New Testament stand on a level
with the rest of the apostolic writings. The Saviour's promise was:
"When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all
truth;" literally, "into all the truth," that is, as immediately
explained, all the truth pertaining to the Redeemer's person and
work. When, therefore, after the fulfilment of this promise, Peter
and the other apostles expounded to their brethren the Scriptures
of the Old Testament, wherein the Spirit of Christ "testified
beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
follow," the same "Spirit of Christ" guided them to a true
apprehension of their meaning. If we cannot trust Peter and Paul,
whom Christ himself personally commissioned to preach his gospel,
qualified for this work by the gift of the Holy Spirit, and endowed
with miraculous powers as the seal of their commission&mdash;if we
cannot trust these men to interpret the words of the Old Testament,
then we cannot trust the guidance of the Divine Spirit himself. But
when we have admitted, as we must, the authority of the New
Testament writers as interpreters of the Old Testament, a very
important question remains to be considered; and that is the
<i>manner of their quotations</i>. This question we propose briefly
to examine in respect to both <i>outward form</i> and <i>inward
contents</i>.</p>
<p>2. As it respects <i>outward form</i>, we cannot but notice at
once the <i>very free spirit</i> of these quotations. It is
manifest that these inspired penmen are not anxious about the
verbal accuracy of the words cited. The spirit and scope of a
passage, which constitute its true life and meaning, are what they
have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page633" id=
"page633"></a>{633}</span> in view, not the exact number of words
literally translated from Hebrew into Greek. It is well known that
a very large part of their quotations is made from the Greek
version of the seventy, called the Septuagint, which was in common
use in their day. No one pretends that the translators who made the
Septuagint were inspired, or that they always succeeded in hitting
the exact meaning of the Hebrew original. Yet, under the guidance
of the Holy Spirit, the robust good sense of the New Testament
writers went straight forward without stopping to notice or
criticise deviations from the Hebrew, provided they did not affect
the use which they wished to make of the passages quoted.</p>
<p>But the New Testament writers do not always conform their
quotations to the Septuagint. They frequently follow the Hebrew
wholly or in part where the Greek version departs from it. Matthew,
in particular, follows the Hebrew in the Messianic quotations.
Chap. 29, No. 19. Yet in these cases also they cite in the same
free manner, abridging sometimes the Hebrew passage quoted, or
giving only its general sense. It may be that thus the wisdom of
God intended to bear testimony against the undue exaltation of the
letter of inspiration above its spirit.</p>
<p>From a list of some two hundred and fifty citations placed side
by side with the original Hebrew passages and the Septuagint
version of the same we select the following as illustrations of the
above remarks, each passage being literally translated. The words
in brackets are regarded by some as not belonging to the true
text.</p>
<p><i>Hebrew.</i> The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because
the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek: he
hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to
the captives, and the opening of the prison to the bound; to
proclaim a year of acceptance to the Lord. Isa. 61:1,2.</p>
<p><i>Septuagint.</i> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because he
hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor; he hath sent
me to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim release to the captives,
and recovery of sight to the blind; to proclaim the acceptable year
of the Lord. Isa. 61:1, 2.</p>
<p><i>New Testament.</i> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because
he hath <span class="pagenum"><a name="page634" id=
"page634"></a>{634}</span> anointed me to preach good tidings to
the poor, he hath sent me [to heal the broken-hearted,] to proclaim
release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to
send away free the bruised (perhaps from the Greek of Isa. 58:6);
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. Luke 4:18, 19.</p>
<p><i>Hebrew.</i> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O
daughter of Jerusalem: behold thy king shall come to thee: he is
just and endowed with salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and
upon a colt the foal of an ass. Zech. 9:9.</p>
<p><i>Septuagint.</i> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion;
proclaim, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold the king cometh to thee,
just and exercising salvation; he is meek, and mounted on an ass
and a young colt. Zech. 9:9.</p>
<p><i>New Testament.</i> Say ye to the daughter of Zion (Isa.
62:11): Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an
ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. Matt. 21:5.</p>
<p>Fear not, O daughter of Zion; behold thy king cometh sitting
upon an ass's colt. John 12:15.</p>
<p><i>Hebrew.</i> In hearing hear ye, but understand not; and in
seeing see ye, but perceive not. Make fat the heart of this people,
and their ears make heavy, and their eyes cover over: lest they see
with their eyes, and with their ears hear, and with their heart
understand, and turn, and one heal them. Isa. 6:9,10.</p>
<p><i>Septuagint.</i> In hearing ye shall hear, but understand not;
and in seeing ye shall see, but perceive not. For the heart of this
people became gross, and with their ears they heard heavily, and
the eyes they closed; lest at any time they should see with the
eyes, and with the ears should hear, and with the heart should
understand, and should turn, and I should heal them. Isa. 6;9,
10.</p>
<p><i>New Testament.</i> In hearing ye shall hear, but understand
not; and in seeing ye shall see, but perceive not. For the heart of
this people became gross, and with the ears they heard heavily, and
their eyes they closed; lest at any time they should see with the
eyes, and with the ears should hear, and with the heart should
understand, and should turn, and I should heal them. Matt. 13:14,
15; also Acts 28:26, 27.</p>
<p>That in seeing they may see and not perceive, and in hearing
they may hear and not understand; lest at any time they should
turn, and [their sins] should be forgiven them. Mark 4:12.</p>
<p>That in seeing they may not see, and in hearing they may not
understand. Luke 8:10.</p>
<p>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they
might not see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and be
turned, and I should heal them. John 12:40.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page635" id=
"page635"></a>{635}</span>
<p>These quotations of the same passage by different New Testament
writers furnish a remarkable example of their free manner, while
the spirit and scope of the prophet are kept by all.</p>
<p>In Heb. 10:5 we have a quotation from the Septuagint where it
differs widely from the Hebrew of Psa. 40:7. This reads: "Sacrifice
and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened"
(Heb. <i>bored</i> or <i>digged</i>). But the apostle quotes after
the Septuagint: "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a
body hast thou prepared for me." The attempted explanations of this
difference are not very satisfactory. It is to be noticed, however,
that the apostle builds no essential part of his argument upon the
clause in question.</p>
<p>In the long quotation from Jeremiah in Heb. 8:8-12, the clause,
"and I regarded them not" (ver. 9), is perhaps correct for
substance; since many prefer to render the corresponding Hebrew
clause not as in our version&mdash;"though I was a husband unto
them,"&mdash;but, "and I rejected them."</p>
<p>When, on the contrary, the spirit and scope of a passage are
lost in the version of the Seventy, the New Testament writers quote
directly from the Hebrew. Examples are the following:</p>
<p>"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
out of Egypt." Hosea 11:1, quoted in Matt. 2:15. Here the Seventy
render: "Out of Egypt I called my children," a variation from the
original which makes the passage inapplicable; since Israel, as
God's first-born son (Exod. 4:22, 23), was the type of Christ, and
not the individual Israelites.</p>
<p>Again, to the passage Isa. 42:1-4, quoted in Matt. 12:18-21, the
Septuagint gives a wrong turn by the introductory words: "Jacob my
son, I will help him: Israel my chosen, my soul hath accepted him:
I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the
Gentiles," etc.; whereas the Hebrew speaks not of Jacob and Israel,
but of God's servant: "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen,
in whom my soul delighteth," etc. Matthew accordingly follows the
Hebrew, yet in a very free manner: "Behold my servant, whom I have
chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul delighteth," etc.</p>
<p>For other examples see Mal. 3:1, as quoted by Matt. 11:10; Mark
1:2; Luke 7:27; Isa. 9:1, 2, as quoted by Matt. 4:15, 16.</p>
<p>3. Passing now to the consideration of the New Testament
citations on the side of their <i>inward contents</i>, the first
question, that arises has respect to the so-called <i>principle of
accommodation</i>. There is a sense in which the writers of the New
Testament sometimes employ the language of the Old in the way of
accommodation; that is, they use its phraseology, originally
applied in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page636" id=
"page636"></a>{636}</span> a different connection, simply as
expressing in an apt and forcible manner the thoughts which they
wish to convey. Of this we have a beautiful example in Rom. 10:18,
where the apostle says, in reference to the proclamation of the
gospel: "But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound
went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the
world," meaning that what the psalmist says of the instruction
given by the heavens, Psa. 19:1-4, is true of the preaching of the
word; so that none are excusable for their unbelief. Another
striking example is found in the same chapter (ver. 6-8), where
"phraseology originally used by Moses to express the way of
justification contained in the law (Deut. 30:11-14) is adapted to
the gospel as properly descriptive of the salvation propounded in
it." Davidson's Hermeneutics, p. 471.</p>
<p>But that the Saviour and his apostles used accommodation in the
commonly received sense of the term; that is, that they quoted, in
accommodation to the ideas of their age, passages from the Old
Testament as applicable to the Messiah and his kingdom, which they
knew to have no such application when fairly and legitimately
interpreted; that, for example, they used the hundred and tenth
psalm as a prophecy of the Messiah (Matt. 22:41-46; Mark 12:35-37;
Luke 20:41-44; Acts 2:34, 35; Heb. 1:13), simply because this was
the current interpretation of their times&mdash;this is not to be
admitted for a moment. That the Saviour dealt prudently with the
prejudices of his age is admitted; but he did not build upon them
his claim to be the Messiah, nor solemnly appeal to the authority
of Moses and the prophets knowing this to be only a dream of
fanciful interpretation. If Christ and his apostles taught any
thing, it was that he had come in accordance with the prophecies of
the Old Testament, and in fulfilment of these prophecies. Did they
indeed, in all this, only act upon the maxim which Paul rejects
with abhorrence as damnable? "If the truth of God hath more
abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as
a sinner? And not rather (as we be slanderously reported, and as
some affirm that we <span class="pagenum"><a name="page637" id=
"page637"></a>{637}</span> say), Let us do evil that good may come?
whose damnation is just."</p>
<p>4. The writers of the New Testament often cite the Old by way of
<i>argument</i>. Thus the Saviour argues against divorce at the
husband's will "for every cause" by an appeal to the original
institution of marriage (Matt. 19:3-6); and Paul proves that the
man is the head of the woman, and that she owes subjection to him,
from the order of creation and its accompanying circumstances. 1
Cor. 11:8, 9; 1 Tim. 2:11-14. Respecting this class of quotations,
it is only necessary to remark that the validity of the arguments
depends on the historic truth and divine authority of the passages
adduced. The Saviour and his apostles professedly build their
arguments on the record of the Old Testament. If this is
sand&mdash;mythical quicksand&mdash;their house falls, and their
authority with it. But if the foundation is rock&mdash;an inspired
record of facts&mdash;their house stands, and with it their
character as truthful teachers.</p>
<p>5. Far more numerous are the passages which are cited as
<i>prophecies of Christ and his kingdom</i>. These are introduced
by various formulas: "That it might be fulfilled which was spoken
of the Lord by the prophet;" "that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by Esaias the prophet;" "in them is fulfilled the prophecy
of Esaias;" "this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears;"
"this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled;" "it is contained
in Scripture;" "another Scripture saith;" "this that is written
must yet be accomplished in me," etc.</p>
<p>The common formula, "that it might be fulfilled," means that the
event recorded took place <i>in order that</i> the purpose of God
announced in the prophecy might be accomplished. The prophecy was
not the main thing, but the purpose of God contained in it. For the
accomplishment of this purpose, and thus of the prophecy which
revealed it, God's truth was pledged. In the same way are to be
understood the words of John (chap. 12:39, 40): "Therefore they
could not believe because that Esaias saith again, He hath blinded
their eyes," etc. The hinderance to their belief lay not in the
prophecy, but in that which the prophecy announced.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page638" id=
"page638"></a>{638}</span>
<p>6. Of the prophecies quoted, some refer <i>immediately to
Christ</i>. Such are the following: "The Lord said unto my Lord,
Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool"
(Matt. 22:44, from Psa. 110:1); "The Lord sware and will not
repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek"
(Heb. 7:21, from Psa. 110:4); "He was led as a sheep to the
slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he
not his mouth," etc. (Acts 8:32, 33, from Isa. 53:7, 8); "A Prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like
unto me; him shall ye hear," etc. (Acts 3:22, 23; 7:37, from Deut.
18:15, 18, 19).</p>
<p>7. Others refer <i>ultimately to Christ, but under a type</i>.
An undeniable example is the following: "A bone of him shall not be
broken" (John 19:36, from Exod. 12:46; Numb. 9:12); words
originally spoken of the paschal lamb, which was the type of
Christ, and now fulfilled in the great Antitype. Again, we read in
Hosea (chap. 11:1): "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and
called my son out of Egypt;" words which Matthew quotes as
fulfilled in Christ (chap. 2:15). It was the purpose of God,
namely, that the history of Israel, God's first-born son (Exod.
4:22, 23), in his national childhood, should foreshadow that of
Jesus, the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<p>To the same class belongs apparently the following citation:
"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that
thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels;
thou crownedst him with glory and honor, and didst set him over the
works of thy hands: thou hast put all things in subjection under
his feet." Heb. 2:6-8, from Psa. 8:4-6. It seems impossible to deny
that the immediate reference of the psalm is to man's exalted
dignity and high prerogatives as the lord of this lower world. But,
as the writer to the Hebrews argues, the words have no complete
fulfilment in man considered apart from Christ. It is in the person
of Christ alone that the high destiny of human nature finds its
full realization. He is made Lord of all, and "crowned with glory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page639" id=
"page639"></a>{639}</span> and honor" for himself and for all his
disciples also, who shall reign with him in glory for ever. We add
one more example from Heb. 1:5, where the writer quotes and applies
to Christ the words of Nathan to David: "I will be to him a Father,
and he shall be to me a Son." 2 Sam. 7:14. The promise undeniably
had immediate respect to Solomon; not to Solomon, however, in his
simple personality, but to Solomon as the first after David of a
line of kings that should end in Christ, in whom alone it has its
true fulfilment. God took Solomon, and in him the whole line of
kings on David's throne, into the relation of sonship, and thus of
heirship. Rom. 8:17; Gal. 4:7. To Solomon, as God's son, the
kingdom was confirmed for ever through Christ; and Solomon's lower
sonship, moreover, adumbrated the higher sonship of the last and
greatest of his sons, to whom the promise was: "He shall be great,
and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall
give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign
over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be
no end." Luke 1:32, 33.</p>
<p>To draw the exact line of separation between the two above named
classes of citations is difficult, and in some cases perhaps
impossible. Nor is it necessary, since the essential truth is, that
all these prophecies find their accomplishment in Christ; those of
the former class directly, those of the latter through types of
divine appointment.</p>
<p>The exegesis of the New Testament quotations presents many
difficult questions, relating partly to the true rendering of the
original words, partly to the deviations of the Septuagint from the
Hebrew, and the citations from both the Septuagint and the Hebrew;
partly to the original application of the passages cited and the
use made of them in the New Testament. For the details the student
must be referred to the commentators. All that has been here
attempted is a statement of the general principles that must govern
us in interpreting the quotations from the Old Testament which are
found in the New. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page640" id=

Vol. IV.</p>
<p>No. (1). PLATE I. <span class="smcap">Sinai Codex</span>,
Century IV. Heb. 12:27-29. Notice the occasional use of very small

<i>palimpsest</i> of Century V. 1 Tim. 3:16, and end of verse 15.
The heavier upper writing in two columns (cursive) is a translation
from Ephraem the Syrian. The paler underneath is the Greek

sections.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
